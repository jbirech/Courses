00:00.210 --> 00:01.560
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:05.000
So we're going to continue adding our style to this page now.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.620
So we do it in the browser so we can see our changes live and I would say if you ever want to move this

00:10.620 --> 00:14.910
to the side you can click on these buttons up here and click on this side button and it bursts over

00:14.910 --> 00:15.450
to the right.

00:15.450 --> 00:19.530
This race you don't have to have it underneath this is somewhere I like to have it so.

00:19.910 --> 00:22.670
But underneath if you want to or move to the side.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.990
And what we do now is style the in book container.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.300
You click on your elements bar and then go.

00:28.350 --> 00:34.350
Extend this background one not you Dana you see input container in the in the container is what holds

00:34.350 --> 00:38.310
all of our input fields or forms for logging in the forms for register.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.760
So we're going to solve this logging container now.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.500
So if you go to the right and click on this registered or csx class here it will take you to the file.

00:46.590 --> 00:50.690
So he is a registered does the S S Class exactly as it matches right here.

00:51.300 --> 00:55.520
And then underneath logging container just per pound symbol.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.050
And then in Purt container like that.

01:01.720 --> 01:06.190
And in there we're going to say width is only 400 peaks.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.800
We have said that are a fixed width.

01:07.980 --> 01:13.260
And in fact are actually stole this in the elements tab so it just should decision an a way of doing

01:13.260 --> 01:13.550
it.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.350
So you see there's the width four hundred we just row.

01:16.490 --> 01:20.010
And if you click on that right now you can type of thing underneath.

01:20.070 --> 01:27.120
So we'll say padding forty five pixels and 45 pixels.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.530
You see the green part are in there the green is the padding to the padding is the space around your

01:31.530 --> 01:32.000
element.

01:32.060 --> 01:32.530
OK.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.450
So 45 pixels padding the different frame padding in mah-jong is padding the space inside of your example.

01:39.450 --> 01:46.560
This input container box the padding is the spacing inside of it where the margin would be padding outside

01:46.560 --> 01:47.080
of it.

01:47.250 --> 01:53.100
So the padding is inside the container and the margin is outside but you'll become more familiar with

01:53.130 --> 01:55.300
both those as we move forward.

01:56.160 --> 02:01.620
So is it having now this poor fellow at and left.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.860
It just keeps everything to the left.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.450
You won't see any changes yet.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.250
And then it's also say border.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.690
Right.

02:09.690 --> 02:14.740
So it's going to apply a board on the right one Picaxe solid.

02:15.150 --> 02:15.660
So there you go.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.990
There's a 1 1 pixel border.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.200
Solid.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.040
And then the colour is going to be pounds 9 9 9 9 like that.

02:25.060 --> 02:29.460
So it's kind of a grey curve I already know that colour beforehand so if you want a change colour you

02:29.450 --> 02:34.440
can click on that whole square and you can change this in see where it looks like red there.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.120
But I know that 9 9 9 the works are really really that.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.950
The reason we use solid is because you can have other things I'd dotted for example and there's light

02:43.950 --> 02:49.810
dots as well but with degrees solid I'm going to change back and that's it for that part.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.090
So copy and paste work code.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.260
Copy Paste in that's of copied it moved back to here.

02:56.520 --> 03:02.940
Paste underneath and save it and I'm going to apply some style to these header tags.

03:03.180 --> 03:11.830
So in the registrar C S S class which is in the source's tab you can just per input container.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.250
H to.

03:13.590 --> 03:14.860
Because h to.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.410
If you look right here if I click on this arrow I can click on this element there and you see it's in

03:19.410 --> 03:20.730
H to tag.

03:20.970 --> 03:22.380
So go at the sources.

03:22.530 --> 03:26.130
So input contain 8 to and all you're saying is one thing in here.

03:26.190 --> 03:32.790
Just text or line centre and it moves the H two tags into the centre.

03:32.820 --> 03:41.320
So copy and paste that one and it needs like that so that there are changes and you don't have to style

03:41.320 --> 03:42.020
this in the browser.

03:42.030 --> 03:44.840
If you just want you want to do all completely here that's fine.

03:44.850 --> 03:49.300
The only thing is if you get to see what you're doing as you typing and get to play around with it.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.260
So we're not flies and start or input feels right now.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.980
So click on this one right here.

03:54.990 --> 04:01.340
This arrow in select one of your inputs and then click on element style and this element style pietist

04:01.350 --> 04:07.350
allows us to apply started this specific thing and see what it looks like so we can just say display

04:08.250 --> 04:08.990
block.

04:09.010 --> 04:14.580
By this you were actually the change on the rest of me because this element style only applies to this

04:14.670 --> 04:15.870
element we're currently on.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.720
Okay so display block or display block does it means this element will be in its own line.

04:21.750 --> 04:25.130
See how the label has gone to its the line above this element.

04:25.130 --> 04:31.500
Now takes up the whole lines and nothing will be alongside it as Display blockaders because a background

04:32.070 --> 04:37.960
colour is it good to be transparent that ICC has gone transparent.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.340
Border 0 no border to give.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.140
Gets rid of the border.

04:44.230 --> 04:48.480
Borders zero border.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.220
Bottom line we will put a border on the bottom.

04:52.560 --> 04:59.890
Say one p x solid and then go make a white border which is just f f f.

04:59.960 --> 05:07.320
That said one p x solid F F F G We have a water underneath now and then we can give this input a high

05:07.320 --> 05:16.820
now so hight is going to be twenty seven pixels and then line height is going to be twenty seven pixels

05:16.820 --> 05:24.950
or so and then width is going to be 100 percent so the input field now takes up the whole width of the

05:25.370 --> 05:28.490
of the space it has out there and that's it.

05:28.490 --> 05:29.410
Let's go once.

05:29.470 --> 05:33.380
Copy and paste this now because Lacazette this is only applying it to one field.

05:33.380 --> 05:34.940
So copy based on that code.

05:35.060 --> 05:39.820
Go back to your residency SS file and we're going to apply it to the

05:42.920 --> 05:54.890
input container and then the input square brackets type he calls text like this.

05:54.890 --> 05:56.180
Place that in there.

05:56.180 --> 06:02.140
And what this is doing is applying this code to all the input field that have the type text.

06:02.260 --> 06:06.420
There also is ibin but contain save that you see.

06:08.690 --> 06:16.670
Fresh off the page and you should see all of these text field have this same style.

06:16.770 --> 06:22.140
The reason these ones don't see is these have the type e-mail and these that the type password they

06:22.140 --> 06:23.410
don't have the type text.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.990
We only target it the ones with the type text.

06:26.130 --> 06:28.450
So if we really do for the password an e-mail once as well.

06:28.590 --> 06:32.800
Just copy and paste that changed this one to email.

06:33.050 --> 06:39.390
That is the comma in between you need the comma and then comma paste all the time and do a password

06:39.390 --> 06:40.460
like that.

06:41.130 --> 06:44.830
Save that and all the others should have that same style.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.680
Now right there.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.360
All these have the same style.

06:48.360 --> 06:54.110
Now when you type you see the Imber goes all the way across the space it has.
