00:00.660 --> 00:01.760
Guys welcome back.

00:01.950 --> 00:06.080
So last time we had this text and here but this doesn't do anything yet so we're going to take you so

00:06.080 --> 00:09.790
that when you click on it it will show or hide the relevant form.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.540
And the way to do that is just with a little where javascript.

00:12.540 --> 00:22.500
So go back to your text editor and create a new file and say this is so we say this in the ascites folder

00:22.560 --> 00:30.240
so ascites big brand new falvey inside of the assets folder so called this J S for jobs.

00:30.690 --> 00:39.130
So now in the Asus fandom have a jazz folder and save the file inside the gess folder as Register.

00:39.260 --> 00:42.270
Yes that save it and they go.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.800
There's our javascript file.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.910
I'm actually going to be using j.crew for this in the moment we don't have Jayco every hour project

00:48.920 --> 00:50.930
so we have to add a reference to that.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.480
So go back to register BHP scroll to the top.

00:54.690 --> 00:59.150
And inside this head tag right here is where the reference to the j.crew library is going to go.

00:59.230 --> 01:03.920
Of those that don't know Jay queries just the javascript library which for the most part just provides

01:03.920 --> 01:09.690
some useful abstraction which allow you to do things in a lot less lines and it will take doing that

01:09.690 --> 01:11.230
with purely javascript.

01:11.790 --> 01:16.640
So go to any tab and just type in Jay Query Oh STD.

01:17.970 --> 01:24.080
And then click on the first one from Google and then you'll see this spyware here.

01:24.090 --> 01:32.490
This script copy and paste that and then go back to your registered AP hpb Agent paste that in there

01:33.150 --> 01:39.560
in Google hosted discharged and Google have hosted this j.crew library for us to use so just by including

01:39.570 --> 01:41.770
that we can now use jaquie.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.460
So now we've got Jay Query referenced and we can use it.

01:44.460 --> 01:48.450
Go back to our Reggie did our James file and it's your first time using J.

01:48.450 --> 01:50.010
Crew or Javascript.

01:50.190 --> 01:52.670
Then you might find some of the syntax confusing.

01:52.670 --> 01:53.120
No idea.

01:53.130 --> 01:57.300
When I started out with an invalid it took me a while to come to grips with it and to really feel comfortable

01:57.300 --> 01:58.380
with it.

01:58.530 --> 02:03.720
I suggest just carry on with it just get through it and you will like everything else I seem to say

02:03.720 --> 02:05.930
in this cause you'll become a lot more familiar.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.040
The more you use it.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.930
So even if you don't fully understand it yet that's fine.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.380
Just go with it and you'll be absolutely fine in due course.

02:13.380 --> 02:17.730
And as always if you have a question just ask me and I'll get back to you real soon.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.790
So explain this where I type it out.

02:19.800 --> 02:28.850
But for now just file on a dollar sign document dart ready and inside the parentheses.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.540
We're going to put function.

02:31.720 --> 02:37.190
Spread the suits there and then the curly brace like that put a semicolon the end of that too.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.890
And what this does is this.

02:38.910 --> 02:44.160
We execute this code as soon as the document is ready and it basically means when the page is ready

02:44.160 --> 02:46.430
in all is dependencies loaded.

02:46.920 --> 02:52.730
So were going to do is write dollar sign with the parentheses s other premises in double quotes.

02:52.770 --> 02:56.040
Put dot Hi log in.

02:57.890 --> 03:01.050
Which is this one right here.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.650
Spam tag.

03:02.930 --> 03:13.870
So I blog in Dopp click like that and in parentheses inside the browser is put function like that with

03:13.880 --> 03:21.110
curly braces that way and put a semicolon in the of that too inside of there just per dollar sign in

03:21.110 --> 03:26.230
parentheses and then pound sign for I.D. log in form.

03:27.780 --> 03:37.870
Hide like that and then copy and paste that below it is Che's log in form to register the form for this

03:38.050 --> 03:39.010
show.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.280
So form.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.540
Show the register form.

03:42.850 --> 03:48.540
Best I guess Wayne is in a minute demaree Copy and paste below and just all we do is do the exact opposite.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.870
So is there a hive in we hide.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.490
Register like that.

03:52.540 --> 03:58.270
This is going to be this stay as long form but change this to show and change this one to hide.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.100
Okay and that's it.

03:59.110 --> 04:00.200
We're done with this.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.100
So let me just explain what this is.

04:03.100 --> 04:03.550
This.

04:03.550 --> 04:09.390
Dollar sign with double coincide inside and then their class all idea should be.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.360
This is a..

04:10.360 --> 04:14.490
Jay Query object and we're creating a jaquie object here with this site.

04:14.950 --> 04:20.890
And was saying when this element is clicked do this and were hiding this element is showing this outman

04:21.600 --> 04:24.490
alternately when this Salamon is great.

04:24.790 --> 04:30.400
Show this one and hide this one and I just realized this should actually be an I.D. So it should be

04:30.500 --> 04:32.060
propounds sign or hash tag.

04:32.110 --> 04:36.460
Some of you should be like that because if you go back to registered up HP you see that we even use

04:36.490 --> 04:38.300
I.D. for this game.

04:38.770 --> 04:43.390
So save that and you see when I refreshes page now providing I did everything right.

04:43.540 --> 04:49.690
One of these show and high when I click on it so I go on that and it's not working and I realize why

04:49.900 --> 04:53.170
we haven't actually linked this javascript far yet.

04:53.230 --> 04:54.570
So go back to regicide up.

04:55.470 --> 05:00.300
I need to actually add a reference to this javascript file about someone great in space underneath just

05:00.360 --> 05:07.500
to separate this year says files with the javascript files and underneath the J query library there.

05:07.650 --> 05:14.410
Maybe you do underneath you don't do above do underneath typescript and then press tab to add this for

05:14.410 --> 05:14.920
you.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.060
I would actually need this part so you can even get rid of that if you want as a regime or 5 you no

05:19.060 --> 05:21.520
longer need to have type text javascript.

05:21.550 --> 05:28.390
Yes you get rid of that just regular it's simpler and inside this first script out in DOS SA sirc he

05:28.420 --> 05:36.950
calls and inside there just put ascites slash J S slash register.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.540
Yes like that.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.290
Save that and that should be good.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.480
Now fresh this.

05:43.490 --> 05:48.020
Now click on one of these and you see patterns here.

05:48.170 --> 05:54.110
And if I took on this it is you error out there.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.490
So I would outworks if it still isn't working for you.

05:57.490 --> 06:03.440
You might just want to go back to your redshirted Yes file and put love print statements in there that

06:04.460 --> 06:06.830
just let you know which things are actually been executed.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.940
So for example you might be one in here.

06:08.960 --> 06:19.400
Consol dog I know say a document is ready right and if when you refresh your page you see this in the

06:19.400 --> 06:20.260
console.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.840
You know that this was executed successfully.

06:22.970 --> 06:24.460
So if I refresh the page now.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.650
And go to my console.

06:27.780 --> 06:32.130
So expect element go to console and I see this which is good.

06:32.130 --> 06:38.240
If you don't see that it means that this code isn't even executing So one of two things is going on.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.120
You have this wrong.

06:39.120 --> 06:45.110
Maybe you've spelled something wrong or something or you might be linked to this file successfully.

06:45.110 --> 06:49.460
So this link here each added might not be correct.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.580
So once you see this you know that this is fine.

06:52.860 --> 07:01.200
You can then move that to inside of here by that and then just change it to something like logging was

07:01.380 --> 07:09.450
pressed and they can't even copy and paste one into the one below that and it changes to register was

07:09.450 --> 07:11.160
pressed.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.270
Then go back to here and then when you press one of these.

07:15.450 --> 07:20.480
You should see a women with breast or register with breast.

07:20.490 --> 07:26.800
If you don't see those you know that the click handler isn't working it's most likely that this selective

07:26.820 --> 07:27.920
wrong so just make sure you're not.

07:27.930 --> 07:29.580
You haven't used a dot here.

07:29.640 --> 07:35.220
Instead of a symbol make sure this is spelled correctly with the right case you out the lowercase L

07:35.220 --> 07:37.870
then it should be in uppercase.

07:38.190 --> 07:38.600
So yeah.

07:38.610 --> 07:43.050
That's just a little way to debug if it's not working any problems just let me know in an hour.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.620
You aren't going.

07:45.420 --> 07:45.990
So that's it.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.310
We have it working.

07:47.310 --> 07:50.040
The only thing we're not doing the moment is show.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.400
Hiding one by default.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.140
So when the paid loads are both shown.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.450
But that's not a problem we'll figure out the next video.
