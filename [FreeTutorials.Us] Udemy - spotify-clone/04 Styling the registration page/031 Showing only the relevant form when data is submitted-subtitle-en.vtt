00:00.300 --> 00:01.530
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.290
So last time we got this text set up so that when you click show are the relevant form.

00:06.300 --> 00:11.780
The problem is when the page loads both the log in form and the register forms showing swimming a while

00:11.780 --> 00:12.400
ago.

00:12.660 --> 00:13.730
So we're going to change that now.

00:13.740 --> 00:20.790
So they only show one where the page loads inside registered appear to be in the body element.

00:20.930 --> 00:24.240
Chris script tag pure script and press tab.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.030
And like I said before you cannot get rid of this if you want to.

00:27.140 --> 00:27.930
You have to.

00:28.030 --> 00:30.280
It just makes things a little bit cleaner.

00:30.480 --> 00:36.160
So inside the script tyred we're going to put the camera that's just so show and hide the relevant form.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.060
I think about Arrested our PSP.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.020
We only have the code that shows or hides one of the forms.

00:41.030 --> 00:48.470
So copy paste all of that go back to our script tag pasted in there and I'll even select all this impressed

00:48.480 --> 00:53.820
tower would move it along just get the spacing correct and then we only want these two lines of code.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.520
So take those.

00:55.530 --> 00:59.790
So copy in that I'm going to get rid of all of this stuff.

01:00.030 --> 01:04.450
So keep the document ready and then just paste those two lines now.

01:05.010 --> 01:10.210
Right now if I say that refresh the page now you'll see only the registe form.

01:10.210 --> 01:10.800
Sharing.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.330
Great.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.470
What if we get the log in form to show.

01:13.470 --> 01:22.790
So if we change this to that show and this sworn hi and refresh that page now you'll see and log in

01:22.800 --> 01:28.440
form shows that we do get a little glimpse of the register form when we the page so we can fix it pretty

01:28.440 --> 01:29.280
easily.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.410
Just go and get the idea of the reges form.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.450
So register for an idea right there.

01:34.560 --> 01:42.120
Go to use the SS file at the bottom just to pounce on your I.D. just the form and just display none

01:42.420 --> 01:43.540
like that.

01:43.630 --> 01:46.540
Now on to refresh the page you see we don't get there.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.470
Register form Sharon.

01:48.720 --> 01:56.330
If I click on this now you see it does show the register form of a card that hides which I form.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.570
Great.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.000
There is a slight problem though.

01:59.130 --> 02:02.100
So like I just said blog inform showing.

02:02.150 --> 02:02.830
Sorry if I know.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.430
Sign up or click on this and I'll fill this out now.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.680
So if I fill this out.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.320
All right.

02:10.750 --> 02:19.290
So I just typed the e-mail in there and now time the email like that so these obviously don't match.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.610
But a password.

02:20.790 --> 02:24.610
And then password if I met this form now.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.620
You see the log in form is show and because the page is refreshed and if I actually going to see that

02:29.620 --> 02:34.670
there are messes I have to click on this just to see the error messages and that's not what they do.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.220
They don't have to refresh the page then click on that to see the rows of the form again.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.180
So what you do.

02:39.330 --> 02:42.720
If they've just submitted the register for show the register form.

02:42.750 --> 02:46.740
If they haven't then show the log in form and that's actually really easy to do.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.660
We need to do is to check whether they pressed the register burn or the log in burn.

02:50.670 --> 02:57.410
So go back to here and into registered of HP and the code here that we used to show and hide it.

02:57.900 --> 03:03.060
So we basically have these same two lines just reverse this form with hiding this will show need to

03:03.060 --> 03:09.150
do is write something that lets us know whether the register but must press the log in bogus breast.

03:09.150 --> 03:14.060
The problem is javascript can't tell when that page PSP bermas pressed.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.890
We can ideologue's BP.

03:16.140 --> 03:21.750
So what we're going to do is some PSP which checks whether the register brand was pressed and if it

03:21.750 --> 03:26.590
was worn out put the relevant script make more sense to you.

03:26.620 --> 03:33.060
Once you see me do it so open appears people are outside of the script out so that's out of the scope

03:33.090 --> 03:36.520
of conveying people for any sign of up is being blocked.

03:36.570 --> 03:37.060
Just do.

03:37.080 --> 03:37.890
If.

03:39.570 --> 03:40.940
Is it.

03:43.100 --> 03:48.010
And then docusign underscore the post register.

03:48.470 --> 03:51.440
BURTON Like that power.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.810
And just to show you are can you say airco.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.410
Hello to say see.

03:57.520 --> 04:05.430
So go out here and fill up the password and then press sinop and you'll see hello top because of the

04:05.450 --> 04:06.040
Britain's was press.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.100
That's how we know.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.390
Okay so this always happens when they wrenched the breast breast.

04:10.390 --> 04:14.750
So if the register bomb was pressed we're going to outplay a science group.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.960
So take this and we're going to print this out.

04:18.290 --> 04:18.800
Okay.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.280
You'll see what I mean now.

04:20.560 --> 04:28.120
So we would say Echo is still in the PSP part of this airco and put a single quote and then paste that

04:28.120 --> 04:32.920
script into there if you want you can move it along just so it's easier for you to see and then Press

04:33.250 --> 04:34.530
sandercoe.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.160
So we're printing this script out.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.830
The reason we used single closely because we really use double quotes inside here so we can't you can't

04:41.830 --> 04:43.570
used that quote.

04:44.170 --> 04:53.800
So if the register was breast akko this one and then we can just say ELDs copy all that pases and the

04:53.800 --> 04:55.680
again just reversed.

04:56.380 --> 05:01.070
So hide and then show that.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.470
And now to argue about it here and submit this again.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.840
So just talk with.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.110
Submit this.

05:10.860 --> 05:14.360
You'll see the log in for I suppose let me just check out those.

05:14.430 --> 05:20.460
The correct way round several register Burns press when I show that they go over there on higher ground.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.400
So you wonder if the rest of us press you to hide the log in form and show the on and down here.

05:26.460 --> 05:33.160
If the rosabel wasn't pressed we want to show the log in form and hide the register form.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.640
Go about it here.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.730
So submit that form again.

05:37.770 --> 05:38.940
Some MIT.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.730
And you'll see the rest of your shows.

05:43.290 --> 05:46.640
And you did see though it flickers.

05:47.990 --> 05:53.180
So you see the log in one first and then switch this and a way round that is just to do the same thing

05:53.180 --> 05:57.100
we did for the Reds to force down here the veggies for me but display none.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.830
You just do exactly the same.

05:58.820 --> 05:59.820
The log in form.

06:00.080 --> 06:04.590
So just put in form that way as well.

06:04.690 --> 06:10.000
Maybe the comma has to apply to both of them edges form and the laurian form both have display none.

06:10.190 --> 06:11.320
So just save that.

06:11.420 --> 06:18.600
And this is just basically saying hi both of them and then let our javascript show the correct one.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.430
So I submit that.

06:23.810 --> 06:24.900
And there you go.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.670
Now we don't see the long form at all.

06:26.940 --> 06:27.980
When we submit the form.

06:29.880 --> 06:34.460
So if I go about to log in for now by press.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.330
Log in.

06:38.370 --> 06:39.900
We see a lot in form.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.950
And there you go is that easy.

06:42.990 --> 06:48.630
So just to reiterate we're using pagg here to determine whether we're going to put this on a page the

06:48.630 --> 06:50.160
script on the page or where it went.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.680
But this script on the page any question it's all just in an honest way it works for you.
