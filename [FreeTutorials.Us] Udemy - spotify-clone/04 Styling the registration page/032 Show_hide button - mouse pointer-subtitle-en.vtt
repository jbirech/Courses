Hey guys.

00:00.720 --> 00:01.470
Welcome back.

00:01.620 --> 00:06.180
So what we did last time is make it so that the user can show and hide this long form depending on what

00:06.180 --> 00:07.490
they want to do.

00:07.530 --> 00:11.400
So if they want to log in they can log in here if they want to register they can click on this part

00:11.400 --> 00:14.360
down here and it will reveal the rest of form.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.140
Why does forget to do those just one little bit of code that makes it so that when you hover over this

00:19.140 --> 00:24.030
down at the bottom it will change the mouse to a pointer which lets you know you can click click like

00:24.030 --> 00:26.210
this has the momeni hover over it.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.900
I don't see that pointer and this is really simple to do.

00:29.910 --> 00:34.650
We actually did it early on the course but you might remember all you do is go to spallone which is

00:34.670 --> 00:35.430
by here.

00:35.580 --> 00:40.750
And just give it a CSI style of cursor pointer like that.

00:40.950 --> 00:41.320
Okay.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.960
And now when you have over that you'll see the mouse pointer.

00:44.280 --> 00:44.920
That's it.

00:45.090 --> 00:48.620
So copy and paste like I did go back to a C as S. file.

00:48.690 --> 00:49.870
Scroll down to the button.

00:49.890 --> 00:57.840
We have this has a count text span part place that in there save the page and then you see when you

00:57.840 --> 01:02.130
refresh the page or close it down to hover over that part.

01:02.130 --> 01:07.600
Now we get the mouse cursor change to a pointer which lets the user know they can click on it.

01:07.650 --> 01:13.800
So just one quick thing that was just a bit of a usability improvement to make things a little bit clearer

01:13.800 --> 01:14.920
for the user.
