WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:03.270
You guys welcome back to where we did last time missile.

00:03.270 --> 00:06.780
This looks a little more similar to my final version.

00:06.810 --> 00:10.130
This one what we didn't do is add this checkmarked though.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.660
And the reason I didn't do the last video is because in this video on the show you really really useful

00:15.660 --> 00:18.950
tool which gives you access to thousands of icons.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.530
They can change colour to use if you like.

00:21.540 --> 00:26.210
So what we do is is download something called ikons 8.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.270
You don't actually have to download this but I do recommend it.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.220
You can simply use it from the website.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.060
If you go to Google and type in icons.

00:36.090 --> 00:36.600
8.

00:36.630 --> 00:37.430
I like that.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.710
And go to the top one.

00:42.110 --> 00:48.420
You get to this Web site here and this is the Web site that gives you access to so many cool icons.

00:48.420 --> 00:53.460
And if you've ever developed anything before you might know how much you are paying is to find arkan's

00:53.470 --> 00:58.410
a match what this star you won in the colour and the right quality too.

00:58.420 --> 01:03.220
So this Web site is one of the best resources I've found since I've started developing.

01:03.340 --> 01:09.190
And they're not paying me for this or anything so I'm not plugging this on my behalf but I just really

01:09.190 --> 01:11.530
really found it useful I spent so long.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.200
And for icons.

01:12.210 --> 01:16.500
But this website actually only found this very recently and I wish I found it sooner.

01:16.510 --> 01:23.020
So if you go to ikons or just shows one of the icons they offer you see if I click on I was 10 or something

01:23.020 --> 01:27.380
like that you get icons fireworks wear style like this.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.020
But also great windows 10.

01:29.150 --> 01:33.540
You have icons that kind of match Windows 10 style.

01:33.560 --> 01:38.830
If you go to no colour you see we have coloured icons like this.

01:39.070 --> 01:48.520
But also if I go in search of something a user user icon for a navigation bar or something you say can

01:48.520 --> 01:55.640
do a bunch of different users that we can use to icon and say I was 10 for Iris 10 you see.

01:55.810 --> 01:57.670
IOW 10 styro ones.

01:57.670 --> 02:00.910
What's also good is we can change the colour of all these as well.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.870
And if you don't want to download this you can do a search on this website and then click download here

02:08.900 --> 02:12.530
and it allows to download it because it change the resolution as well.

02:12.770 --> 02:18.950
So I can make the a smaller economy a bigger icon and you also click generate a dml which will do this

02:18.950 --> 02:19.450
for you.

02:19.460 --> 02:22.920
Give you the 18 now you need to display your economy page.

02:22.940 --> 02:29.480
The only thing is if you do use these you will have to give them credit for the Archons you use if you

02:29.480 --> 02:34.370
don't have that pay plan so you don't have to buy anything is free to use.

02:34.520 --> 02:40.640
But there are some limitations if it's free you can only use PRNG firehose you.

02:40.670 --> 02:43.840
The maximum size you can take is an injured pixels.

02:43.980 --> 02:48.920
You can still download the app for it which gives you all the icons off line but you do have to as it

02:48.920 --> 02:50.960
says here linked to this Web site.

02:51.050 --> 02:56.810
And what that means is when you use it you have to give credit saying I've got my icon from I can't

02:56.820 --> 02:57.310
say.

02:57.490 --> 03:02.960
Okay so you do is now you have a paid on your website like credits or something when you click on AOL

03:03.020 --> 03:05.540
say our funds provided by our account.

03:05.930 --> 03:10.310
I actually do have the unlimited plan so I can export my files to svga.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.290
Yes anything like that.

03:12.350 --> 03:13.610
It's really really good.

03:13.680 --> 03:18.890
Like I say not being paid for anything this is not what that is but I just really think this is useful.

03:18.890 --> 03:20.090
So we'll go ahead and download this.

03:20.090 --> 03:26.700
Now you just click download and you click on day app like that and it should stop download for you.

03:26.750 --> 03:31.260
Or I should say will do that when you click on it download our icons apron.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.050
So I really have it in stores.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.170
We're not going to say it again but you can go ahead and do that.

03:38.390 --> 03:44.100
And then when you have it in stores or close tabs down now when you have it now you show you you open

03:44.100 --> 03:45.510
it up.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.980
This is app it gives you an app like this.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.070
So it's only a click away from the Apple disappears.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.260
It's up here in my case.

03:52.280 --> 03:58.670
But you can click it down there and you have access to all of those icons and maybe I want an arrow

03:58.670 --> 03:59.390
or something.

03:59.420 --> 04:04.430
But all these different kinds of arrows to use can get different styles maybe in development and to

04:04.430 --> 04:11.120
a device or a couple of hours like that or I can choose my hours here I can change the colour this way

04:11.330 --> 04:12.950
so far and make it green.

04:12.950 --> 04:17.040
I can do or blue and you change the colour of all of these icons.

04:17.150 --> 04:20.830
So maybe I will do this I can't but I will in yellow or something like that.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.240
I can do that or if I want in blue like that.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.810
But I actually want this to be in the spotfire grinker.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.890
Let me just inspect darling get that colour.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.340
So I'll go to here and you see that in a log in text.

04:34.370 --> 04:41.240
H1 we use the Spotify I agree here on a copy that colour code here and then go back to our icon day

04:41.680 --> 04:47.130
and gonna make these all green.

04:47.780 --> 04:51.580
And I'm going search for check or check mark.

04:51.650 --> 04:53.950
You see right here we have one you've got to one.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.970
I'll just bet you are one of the slightly thinner and then the slightly larger.

04:58.040 --> 05:03.650
And if they get smaller or larger I can do it up here because a hundred pixels at the moment is a bit

05:03.650 --> 05:06.320
too large for an eye I don't want to be that big.

05:06.580 --> 05:11.870
It would take too long to own website so we can actually just make this into a paint 25 that's actually

05:11.870 --> 05:12.630
fine.

05:12.710 --> 05:16.600
So use being 25 and you can just drag that into your folder.

05:16.640 --> 05:24.080
But let me just make sure I have my folder open so ascites images and we want to train our icons for

05:24.080 --> 05:25.550
the inside of the images folder.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.660
So in there in SBM just folder and just create a new folder.

05:30.730 --> 05:38.850
Our marketing Comanche of Dan neuquen do file new folder and just name it icons like that.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.880
And inside the icons folder you can now just drag from icons 8 into there.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.590
And you see changes to a checkmark.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.430
And we're going to just rename this to just check mark like that.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.760
Okay check mark doppie N G.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.810
And that means we can go back to our success file.

05:58.810 --> 06:07.370
And inside here we're just going to say background you are L and practices like that and it's out there

06:07.620 --> 06:15.390
do dot dot last quarter and go up one folder because lambrusco says file it's currently in here.

06:15.530 --> 06:26.930
I'm going to go up one folder here and into the images folder images slash cons slash check mark dot

06:27.290 --> 06:37.730
E and G like that case VAP go back to here and refresh the page and hopefully we'll see a checkmark

06:38.090 --> 06:38.680
which you do.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.210
But that's not great it's repeating it.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.690
Oh I know I forgot to do after this.

06:43.690 --> 06:44.840
We only need to do.

06:44.870 --> 06:45.950
No.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.990
Repeat like that.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.230
That.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.510
And then it's also in the wrong place.

06:53.700 --> 06:59.410
And I think on top ahead I think we just do 0 0 which is just there X on Y positions.

07:00.160 --> 07:00.490
OK.

07:00.510 --> 07:03.640
So still not quite right inspect element on that.

07:04.050 --> 07:10.490
And it might be the padding we need to play with padding driving this 0 10.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.430
Yeah.

07:13.230 --> 07:15.480
It moves over more if I change at 10.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.330
So if I move that 10 more you'll see that it moves.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.680
How long sakin do they pixels there.

07:22.710 --> 07:29.560
And if I won do someone toppan barn I can do like that.

07:29.940 --> 07:38.130
Interstice do five pixels in five pixels do in five pixels on top and bottom and 30 pixels left and

07:38.130 --> 07:38.620
right.

07:38.830 --> 07:39.310
Okay.

07:39.480 --> 07:39.960
And that's it.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.280
We have our checkmarks there and don't get ratty about style in your see.

07:44.370 --> 07:47.210
While that moment if you refresh the page it won't be there.

07:47.310 --> 07:58.410
So don't you see a SAS file and logging text Elvira here changed the padding to 5 x 30 acts like that.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.180
So that's it.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.850
Obviously you don't download icons.

08:00.850 --> 08:04.500
You have to maybe have your own icons or maybe you want to find your own online.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.290
But I just really really love this.

08:06.300 --> 08:11.920
I wish more people knew about it so I went every down in icons in this cause I'll be using this app.

08:11.940 --> 08:16.390
But like I said when I do that you can just take your icons from where you want.
