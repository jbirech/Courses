00:00.680 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:07.560
So in last video we got these checkmarked setter from those restored icons eight icons up what we're

00:07.560 --> 00:10.750
going to do now is style the error messages that appear.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.150
For example if I enter the wrong data.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.450
You'll see that we have this error message but doesn't look very good as just three lines of style Faramir

00:19.450 --> 00:20.200
correctly.

00:20.290 --> 00:22.840
So inspect element on that.

00:23.530 --> 00:29.830
So the error message span right here we're just going to say colour and this is going to be the same

00:29.830 --> 00:31.210
spot light green.

00:31.210 --> 00:33.670
And if you don't remember the colour on the go look it up.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.730
You can just do FFG or any colour you want.

00:36.730 --> 00:37.110
Right.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.640
And then click on this bird right here there's a square.

00:39.670 --> 00:44.710
It'll open this up and then you can move your mouse onto that colour and it would take that colour out

00:44.710 --> 00:45.300
there.

00:45.580 --> 00:45.870
Okay.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
Precentor.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.510
Font size is going to be 12 pixels you want this to be fairly small.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.950
And then see how this username appears an x ray using a label we just willing make that appear on a

00:58.940 --> 00:59.520
new line.

00:59.530 --> 01:04.000
When you say display block like that and that's great.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.060
Copy and paste that get back to you see yes this file an amber.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.270
This span is called error message.

01:09.370 --> 01:24.910
So I mean just say in that container space in an error message paste in there you could just have it

01:24.910 --> 01:26.400
as error message instead.

01:26.410 --> 01:32.620
But just to make the deselected a bit more descriptive which is always better is you can put in container

01:32.670 --> 01:38.170
as well because it falls into the input content like that sorry we've applied the style.

01:38.170 --> 01:46.480
Now if we save that refresh the page we should still see that so refresh the page and then so the wrong

01:46.480 --> 01:48.210
data again.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.040
And you see we have our style.

01:52.070 --> 01:56.230
We also are going to add some spacing to that label.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.940
I guess we forgot to do that.

01:58.090 --> 02:01.020
So when I made this label have some margin on our way.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.280
We did get enlargen.

02:04.510 --> 02:11.940
Maybe give this display a block like that and then the margin actually applies and display blocks just

02:11.950 --> 02:16.600
means that it displays the block element and no items get here on the side.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.210
And it takes into account the positions of the surrounding elements as well.

02:20.260 --> 02:24.670
So we added the display block to there and that means the margin we added are actually working now.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.830
So just make sure you member to copy and paste our display block.

02:28.990 --> 02:32.680
Go back to redstart see assess and I can see here it's like 74.

02:32.740 --> 02:41.430
So go to like 74 and just pay stiner by that and then save that scenario.

02:41.560 --> 02:46.900
We started our messages and then we also added a little bit side to this that we've got to do.
