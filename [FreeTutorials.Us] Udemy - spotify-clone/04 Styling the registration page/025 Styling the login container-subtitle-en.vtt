WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.380
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.380 --> 00:06.630
So last time we applied this code here to give our page a background image so we can continue styling

00:06.630 --> 00:07.530
this now.

00:07.860 --> 00:13.080
And first thing we do is get rid of this border around the image and as reason we do go back to here

00:13.080 --> 00:19.110
and we'll put this right at the top because it's going to be the code base code just but h.t. AML comma

00:19.700 --> 00:20.430
body.

00:20.690 --> 00:25.650
And what the column means is it applies to this and it also applies to that right so that we're applying

00:25.650 --> 00:28.680
this code to the A C mail We're also flying to the body.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.660
If you look in here if you didn't know already the 8th email tags arounds are a whole a c of our document.

00:33.690 --> 00:34.850
Okay right there.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.490
So goes top to bottom.

00:36.750 --> 00:43.130
So inside there we just kind of put padding zero.

00:43.290 --> 00:47.900
That margin is zero.

00:48.340 --> 00:53.030
And then height 100 percent.

00:53.230 --> 01:00.900
That and if ivester page now you see that's got rid of our border I guess because by default the astm

01:00.900 --> 01:03.270
outtake has some padding it has a margin risk.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.580
Absolutely a space between the elements and the borders.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.560
Okay so we just got rid of that.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.420
So the other thing these asml properties is there's a lot of them.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.640
So I won't be able to explain every single one in detail as we go.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.020
It is take far too long.

01:17.190 --> 01:20.070
So what I'll do is are trying to win them as best I can as I type.

01:20.070 --> 01:25.430
But if you have a little bit more information you can ask me some questions or just google search it

01:25.440 --> 01:29.240
and there's this so many pages explaining these things in a lot of detail.

01:29.280 --> 01:35.970
So if you don't understand something ask me questions follow along and I really think you understand

01:35.970 --> 01:40.290
as you move forward or just take a little Google search on your own and you'll find what you looking

01:40.290 --> 01:40.640
for.

01:40.690 --> 01:41.350
Okay.

01:41.820 --> 01:44.160
But I will try our best to explain as I go.

01:44.610 --> 01:52.140
So we know Blossom's more started this page now and we'll go back to read stoppie HP and then in between

01:52.140 --> 01:58.500
the background div and the input contain a Or between there really create one more div around.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.650
So this was Ruby div.

02:00.830 --> 02:07.030
It's good to have that idae of log in container.

02:07.710 --> 02:08.760
Okay.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.460
And as the last time.

02:11.670 --> 02:18.520
Get the devinder NEED THEM be a tab it along to the right one space so go all the way down to here.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.950
Right there that's the closing date for that says left all of that press tab and move it along on one

02:23.970 --> 02:29.190
space and then underneath that put you closing did one for the did you just created.

02:29.510 --> 02:33.970
So there's the closing div for this lauring contain a div right.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.400
And the reason we do that is because this logging container Dave is going to surround all of the code

02:38.400 --> 02:40.090
on this page.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.790
All right this input contain do is only going to surround the input because later on we're going to

02:44.790 --> 02:50.140
have another day of outside of this div which will have some information which looks like this.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.470
So later I'm going have this live as well.

02:53.820 --> 02:58.870
So this long time today is going to just surround all the codes and surround all of this.

03:00.070 --> 03:01.600
So what is it about it that save it.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.500
Go back to our stage.

03:05.490 --> 03:13.800
And then create that idea to the power symbol log in container and then press star.

03:13.890 --> 03:17.580
So logging container start and the star means all.

03:17.580 --> 03:22.830
So this code will be applied to everything in the logging container this kind of way you can put your

03:22.830 --> 03:27.780
base Cola use your default font size and fonts type with colours and stuff.

03:27.990 --> 03:34.240
So this is going to be all the default code you want to be applied with everything in this div rena's

03:34.260 --> 03:36.660
a colour.

03:38.070 --> 03:43.680
I say that and you should see white font colour.

03:43.870 --> 03:47.740
And in fact we're going to continue styling this code from the browser right here.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.600
So I guess you see you're changed as you type.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.730
So reichlin inspect element.

03:53.530 --> 03:57.880
And if you click on this our a top allows choose which element you want to just choose one of these

03:57.880 --> 04:01.660
with the white styling applied then you can see this code right here.

04:01.660 --> 04:06.550
This logic container code if you wanted to you could click on this registered or see assess link right

04:06.550 --> 04:11.560
here and it would show you your registered or see assessed file to this file matches exactly with the

04:11.560 --> 04:12.890
value here.

04:13.090 --> 04:17.940
And if you want you can add you styling this way we can give this a better looking font.

04:17.940 --> 04:21.750
Now this is a font family.

04:22.630 --> 04:30.100
And then in there we can use but Helvetica near you I don't and you say that by now this is the I want

04:30.100 --> 04:31.180
to use.

04:31.290 --> 04:34.000
Helvetica Can you see something.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.490
Oh no.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.660
So that's the new double quotes comma.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.090
And put another font which you just Helvetica.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.290
After that more double quotes.

04:45.670 --> 04:54.460
Arielle and and after that sans serf like that and use what you do in age you specified backup fonts

04:54.460 --> 04:57.040
of this font doesn't work you use that one of that doesn't work.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.720
You use that one to D does it back at once.

05:01.270 --> 05:03.830
So how that's occurred knew you were you.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.490
Is the one we're going to using again.

05:05.650 --> 05:06.740
I'm sure that's so.

05:06.820 --> 05:11.350
So go underneath them we're going to say find a way.

05:11.380 --> 05:18.370
This is a normal fun way is just how thick you want the text to be which is but normal there and then

05:18.430 --> 05:24.450
the line height is going to be one e m.

05:24.710 --> 05:29.110
And what I am is is is a scalable unit of measurement for the font size.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.440
So one of them is just whatever the font size currently is.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.880
So if the current one size is 12 pixels and you say on one EM It means this will be 12 pixels.

05:38.020 --> 05:43.680
If you said to me it means the line would be 24 pixels be two times 12 pixels.

05:43.790 --> 05:48.810
So EMG takes whether the font size is and goes off that really is looking a little way better.

05:48.850 --> 05:49.500
Does it look grey.

05:49.510 --> 05:54.440
But again get there and then we'll one more thing in there just a box sizing.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.960
And in that border box and you won't really see any changes to that yet.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.640
But I know we want to put that one on the border box.

06:02.650 --> 06:08.170
Does is it means that when you specify a wit for something it should take into account the padding in

06:08.170 --> 06:08.960
the margins.

06:09.010 --> 06:14.320
So I just put that in there the moment and that that will help you as you go forward and then we'll

06:14.320 --> 06:15.840
put another thing underneath that.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.850
So underneath lovick container Starr put

06:21.670 --> 06:24.730
another log in container.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.320
Taina like that.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.990
And then this comes just like luggin containerize.

06:28.990 --> 06:32.460
So no other attributes afterwards is out there.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.880
80 percent.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.490
So this logging contained it did.

06:39.490 --> 06:46.980
Now if I go out to the elements tab you'll see this logging container div has a width of 80 per cent

06:46.980 --> 06:49.830
see the blue part is 80 percent of the page width.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.030
So go out to sources.

06:52.150 --> 06:59.400
Those are is 80 percent margin no say zero and then Auto.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.050
And what that does is it means the top and bottom we're to have zero.

07:04.050 --> 07:07.360
And the left and right are going to have an auto margin.

07:07.890 --> 07:15.090
So to show you what that means is I go out to here and go out a long container that container out there

07:15.340 --> 07:18.500
you see the the orange part is the margin.

07:18.510 --> 07:19.920
The blue buys out container.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.610
See how centred it in the middle now.

07:21.810 --> 07:26.850
So we said no margin the top and bottom which is why the blue bar goes right to the top but left and

07:26.850 --> 07:29.900
right is auto and auto actually centred it by default.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.750
Okay so this is in the middle now.

07:33.480 --> 07:43.860
Go back to sources say a position relative and that means it positions it relative to its parent and

07:43.860 --> 07:45.170
then Max.

07:45.410 --> 07:49.420
We're going to be ten twenty four pixels.

07:49.560 --> 07:55.100
So no matter how big your screen is don't let this get any bigger than ten twenty four pixels gay.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.110
You don't have several.

07:56.110 --> 07:58.980
This mean that it will just keep getting bigger and bigger.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.890
As long as they have a screen big enough.

08:01.070 --> 08:01.720
I see this.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.220
Don't let it get any bigger.

08:03.590 --> 08:10.660
One doesn't 24 pixels and that's actually for Logan Utena so ready we have a little bit better looking

08:11.340 --> 08:12.630
better looking.

08:12.830 --> 08:13.930
Page right there.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.620
But remember we haven't actually saying that code.

08:16.740 --> 08:17.680
So we actually have.

08:17.880 --> 08:25.950
So we do have to go and copy and paste this into our file or so copy all that new code and paste it

08:25.950 --> 08:26.770
into their archives.

08:26.780 --> 08:32.930
I tried this paste it there and save that now means when you refresh this page you should see your changes.
