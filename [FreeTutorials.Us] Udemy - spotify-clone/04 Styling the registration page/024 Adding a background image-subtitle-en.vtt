WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:01.800
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.800 --> 00:05.630
So now we have a session variable set up which allows to stay locked down.

00:05.650 --> 00:09.470
We can go and apply some styling to this now because although it doesn't look very good.

00:09.870 --> 00:13.290
So go back to our editor and create a new file.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.260
I'm going to save this in the assets folder and then go create a new folder inside of that Called see

00:19.310 --> 00:24.330
SS So create see the new folder inside of assets folder.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.440
And this is where going to save our file.

00:26.750 --> 00:33.470
So save it as Register see SS registered or see assess.

00:33.930 --> 00:35.220
So there's a file.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.280
Now go back to register BHB.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.900
How many to make a reference to it.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.710
Because at the moment this file knows nothing about that file.

00:41.850 --> 00:49.280
So in the head tag right here underneath title we're going to write link.

00:49.300 --> 00:55.050
And if you press tab if using a one text anyway press tab it'll fill in all of this for you which basically

00:55.050 --> 00:58.920
lets the page know that this is a csx reference.

00:59.160 --> 00:59.780
So.

01:00.850 --> 01:10.260
In the hsf part we put our link to our success file so that was assets slash csx slash register dot

01:10.330 --> 01:12.220
csx and that's it.

01:12.220 --> 01:19.270
We've linked to our seats as far now anything we put in here will be reflected in our age.

01:19.270 --> 01:21.670
So we're going to great a background image for us.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.710
But a big background image and if I show you what it actually looks like this is the image you're not

01:25.720 --> 01:26.220
using.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.210
This is my actual site.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.180
And this image will be included with the course content so you can use this one if you want to or Obviously

01:35.180 --> 01:36.630
you can go and find your own image.

01:36.740 --> 01:41.690
So this image has saved my desktop at the moment so I don't get that saux right here.

01:41.730 --> 01:47.410
So is copy this and I'll paste it in assets folder.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.500
Images and.

01:49.820 --> 01:50.850
Right here.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.950
Inside the assets images folder.

01:53.080 --> 01:53.930
Save that.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.730
So the image is ready to use now.

01:56.890 --> 02:03.310
When we go back to our registered iph P page created for this background.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.080
So right give give give give an idea of.

02:09.130 --> 02:16.750
Background like that my deep background made move this along to get this div input container there and

02:16.750 --> 02:19.660
select all the way down to its closing day of this one.

02:19.660 --> 02:20.760
So all of that.

02:20.950 --> 02:21.850
Okay.

02:21.850 --> 02:29.290
And press tab and move all of that along and then underneath that put the closing Dave on for your new

02:29.440 --> 02:30.400
background div..

02:30.580 --> 02:39.390
So all I did is move our existing code across one space so we have our new div there and on the closing

02:39.390 --> 02:40.000
div.

02:40.450 --> 02:45.880
So we connected by some style to this now so in a sense does this as File we're going to type pound

02:45.970 --> 02:53.410
symbol or hash tag of some as you know as background like that has to be that simple because it is a

02:53.410 --> 02:58.500
reference I.D. because we don't use class background used by D.

02:59.230 --> 03:05.930
So they're going to say background colour 0 0 0.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.360
That was the black background.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.650
This is a colour code for the colour black.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.160
Actually if you save that then go back to here.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.070
Just make sure you see those changes versus page.

03:17.660 --> 03:18.490
And there it is.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.850
If you don't see it you might need to clear a cache.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.430
So if I right click and inspect element right here.

03:25.970 --> 03:31.670
What this inspect element is allows me to see it and see all of the 80 mile code behind the scenes so

03:31.670 --> 03:36.280
I can see there's the input right here and this all corresponds to the code you see here.

03:36.290 --> 03:39.620
Just without the BHB so you won't you won't see any page picone here.

03:39.710 --> 03:42.950
But you see all of your code from here in the browser.

03:42.950 --> 03:46.880
So for example there's new background div and there it is right there.

03:47.630 --> 03:50.300
So if you're not seeing your changes.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.580
Firstly go to console this time of year.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.170
Make sure you not seeing any errors.

03:54.170 --> 03:57.960
So for example for four hours saying they can't find this SS file.

03:58.460 --> 04:04.790
But if with this open you can right click on their refresh burn at least in Chrome any way you can run

04:04.790 --> 04:09.710
click on a refresh and click go empty cash and hard reload and no clear the cash and do a reload for

04:09.710 --> 04:13.050
you so maybe and that might fix your problem.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.520
But if you click on this background here.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.710
The one we create in it the new background of regraded.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.730
You'll see there's our code of which is made the background colour.

04:25.730 --> 04:26.990
Zero right there.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.910
This is the.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.470
This is what we just wrote.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.430
So it's right there.

04:31.430 --> 04:35.840
And if you apply this style right here you'll see the changes light as you type which makes it a little

04:35.840 --> 04:37.910
bit easier to play around and make it look better.

04:38.060 --> 04:46.940
So we'll just right back around the image like that press tab to move along and the valley for that

04:46.940 --> 04:48.880
is going to be you are all over in francises.

04:48.890 --> 04:52.910
And then we need the path through our image and we're in the csx fold at the moment.

04:52.910 --> 05:01.130
So we're currently in the E C S S folder so we need to go to get to our image from here we go back one

05:01.130 --> 05:04.520
folder into the images folder and right there.

05:04.790 --> 05:05.400
So.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.520
Type out again background image.

05:10.580 --> 05:18.920
We say you are well open practices we go back one folder which is what Dot Dot flusters images and then

05:18.920 --> 05:20.500
the image is call B G.

05:20.570 --> 05:20.970
J.

05:21.050 --> 05:21.920
P. G.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.720
Like that's pretty closing brackets on.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.300
And you should tip press antenna day down to line below.

05:27.320 --> 05:35.370
Now a change of position of this back ground position and then put centre like that.

05:35.870 --> 05:44.390
And underneath that we're going to say background size and the background size we would say cover which

05:44.390 --> 05:51.280
makes it spread across the whole page and then display table.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.750
Explain that a little bit.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.930
So just just type that out for now.

05:55.390 --> 06:00.530
Hyde it's going to be 100 percent because we won't take 100 percent of the page height width is going

06:00.530 --> 06:05.890
to be also 100 percent because we want that to take up 20 percent of the page width and that's it for

06:05.900 --> 06:06.430
now.

06:06.680 --> 06:11.490
So you see we have this image right here on our page it looks pretty good.

06:11.720 --> 06:18.250
So copy they saw this code because if you look back our page you don't see the code you just made.

06:18.290 --> 06:22.610
So you have to copy and paste it into your editor.

06:22.610 --> 06:28.850
So save that for the fact that you don't see or changes is good because you can play around with things

06:28.850 --> 06:29.560
and you weren't.

06:29.580 --> 06:35.390
If I you know if I want to play around with something maybe change the values of these to 75 percent

06:35.390 --> 06:39.200
and see what it looks like you can see the changes and if you don't like them you can just refresh the

06:39.200 --> 06:40.550
page and they'll be gone.

06:40.550 --> 06:45.030
When you refresh your page it all goes back to highs in the in your text file.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.550
So that's it a real quick introduction to this.

06:47.560 --> 06:53.360
SS We just added a background image to our page and then we'll be styling all of this to make this look

06:53.360 --> 06:54.700
better.
