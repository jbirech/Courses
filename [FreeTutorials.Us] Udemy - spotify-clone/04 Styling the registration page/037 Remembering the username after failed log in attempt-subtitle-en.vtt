00:00.510 --> 00:04.470
So what we do in this video is just fix something I forgot to do before.

00:04.580 --> 00:12.030
And you know if we try to sign in and we get it wrong it doesn't remember the whose name I forgot to

00:12.030 --> 00:12.760
add that part.

00:12.810 --> 00:18.090
So all we do is go back and decide that that deregistered up here be page if you remember we did this

00:18.090 --> 00:20.160
earlier with our register form.

00:20.280 --> 00:24.180
All we did is have a value out of you on the text boxes.

00:24.460 --> 00:29.010
They're called this get input value function that we wrote here.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.400
So we get in value right here.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.560
Just takes a name and a guess that post variable with that name.

00:35.740 --> 00:36.340
Okay.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.750
So all I need to do is add that to the to the use and just box and that's it.

00:40.950 --> 00:48.780
So go down to the username text box inside the log in form and then just per value.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.460
And then what did we call this.

00:50.460 --> 00:55.290
That should be logged in username caja because member it goes off the name.

00:55.410 --> 00:58.720
So log in username and that's it.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.600
Now reverse the page.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.250
If I resubmit that Form sadeh rescanning then I'll get the password wrong.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.470
So bring it back to here.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.740
You should see the username there again.
