00:00.470 --> 00:01.740
Guys welcome back.

00:01.740 --> 00:07.110
What we're going through now is add this text at the bottom of here that uses dress to switch between

00:07.110 --> 00:09.980
the sign up and the dog forms.

00:10.110 --> 00:16.590
So go back to your regidor opinions page and scroll down to underneath the button right here and just

00:16.590 --> 00:27.180
create a div and give this the idea of how has that count text.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.940
This is a text that asks them where they have an account already and then they're all over it just an

00:32.940 --> 00:38.850
anchor tag suppress a press tab and h.f. is going to be to the pound sign.

00:38.850 --> 00:43.770
It's not going to link to anywhere and it's there was can address span element.

00:44.010 --> 00:50.580
And the idea of this is just going to be high again like that.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.580
And the text can just be don't have an account yet.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.510
Yet with a question mark sign here.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.610
I like that.

01:02.970 --> 01:04.020
Okay and that's it.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.110
That's simple.

01:05.190 --> 01:09.490
Now copy and paste up all over as well because we do the same for the register form.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.580
So underneath the register button and it estrellas we shouldn't use I.D. for this we should actually

01:14.580 --> 01:19.350
use class because I.D. should be unique on the page.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.610
This should only ever be one element with that I.D..

01:21.810 --> 01:26.970
So we're going to change this to class came because they're both class same class.

01:26.970 --> 01:35.610
And the idea of the spallone right here is just going to be hide register like that tax.

01:35.660 --> 01:42.090
You can just change to something like I already have an account.

01:42.090 --> 01:47.040
Question mark the log in here a save that.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.280
And you see some text underneath our forms.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.970
Now there you go.

01:51.990 --> 01:52.970
There's our text.

01:53.270 --> 01:57.330
And that's a style that just right click inspect allaman.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.130
There's not a whole lot of style to do.

01:59.430 --> 02:09.330
So select your span element right there and again say font weight it's going to be bald font size 12

02:09.330 --> 02:12.470
pixels for free to use whatever font size you want of course.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.980
And then actually no that's it.

02:14.980 --> 02:15.860
Let's leave it at that.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.360
So just the two lines were simple.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.970
Now go back to your style.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.930
You registered our CSF file.

02:22.470 --> 02:31.240
And then at the bottom just has a count taxmen we have class so we have to use a dot.

02:32.370 --> 02:34.630
And then just do span like that.

02:36.620 --> 02:40.320
Paste it in there and.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.180
Is get the spacing correct.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.110
That's it.

02:45.110 --> 02:45.650
That's good.

02:45.650 --> 02:50.000
And then at which you go to the element of both that that's what the spallone here go to the div above

02:50.000 --> 02:52.070
it and read add one line here.

02:52.100 --> 02:56.810
You can me text a line centre like that position in the centre.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.440
So just copy that.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.990
Go back to your style.

03:01.100 --> 03:11.000
We can just say has a count text text and just paste in there and that's it.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.570
I mean just refresh this a C that changes.

03:16.270 --> 03:18.530
And it's you see the text at the bottom there.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.620
And next thing to do is use email.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.560
This actually works.

03:21.580 --> 03:24.440
When you press it you show or hide the relevant form.
