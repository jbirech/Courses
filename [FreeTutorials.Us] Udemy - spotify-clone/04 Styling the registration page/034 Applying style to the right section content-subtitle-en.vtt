00:00.230 --> 00:01.710
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:07.260
So last time we started work on this tax story here and we see how it looking like this a moment because

00:07.260 --> 00:09.010
we don't have a style applied to it.

00:09.090 --> 00:11.480
So that's what we do in this valeria's is style.

00:11.490 --> 00:17.790
So it looks like this in the end and there is a whole lot of style to do you suspect elements.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.910
You can see what we're actually dealing with.

00:20.250 --> 00:25.350
And we'll start with this logon text content right here which is the container around all of this text

00:25.350 --> 00:27.620
here and running it had two lies.

00:27.630 --> 00:32.900
This all we do is just drop padding as forty five pixels.

00:32.950 --> 00:39.450
And of course feel free to play around these values as you like and we should say display table cell

00:39.480 --> 00:46.020
like that and that just makes it behave like a table cell element which is you know TDR like that.

00:46.420 --> 00:51.270
I by that much more now because we'll use it later on in the Course area become a lot clearer to you

00:51.270 --> 00:52.080
then.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.950
So for now just put those two there in logon text out an ad like this.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.410
So copy paste has two lines of code.

00:58.410 --> 01:00.190
Go back to a S file.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.310
So I need to open it.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.990
So YES YES YES YES YES.

01:05.070 --> 01:06.030
Scroll down.

01:06.120 --> 01:14.920
And would it get to an I.D. the log in text like and just pesos two lines in there case over.

01:15.030 --> 01:18.410
Then we add some style to these headed tags right here.

01:18.450 --> 01:24.310
So at age one I mean this is that green one we're going to say cola which is the text colour.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.700
And I know what colour this is I've written down here so just copy along.

01:27.700 --> 01:31.160
3 1 0 7 d.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.200
1 5 9.

01:33.210 --> 01:33.640
Like that.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.410
You see it turns to that green colour.

01:35.580 --> 01:38.840
Of course if you look now you can play around with any of these colours you like.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.200
But that's the code we use as the Spotify screen.

01:43.260 --> 01:48.030
Next one is a font size 60 pixels like that.

01:48.030 --> 01:54.300
And then which can make it bold by saying font weight bold like that.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.480
Okay.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.380
Obviously you can play around with these rallies as you like.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.150
So that's fine.

02:00.180 --> 02:05.830
Copy those three lines go back to here underneath there just do the same again.

02:05.850 --> 02:10.240
Log in log in sext and then do a one.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.780
So the 81 one that falls in the log in text Outman.

02:14.010 --> 02:22.110
They say that and he has a copy and paste a line below and changes to h to get rid of these three lines

02:22.110 --> 02:22.530
of code.

02:22.540 --> 02:25.070
These were only those Yeah during the H to.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.700
And I go out here and show you.

02:26.710 --> 02:34.630
So I click on age 2 and we give this a margin so margins go to be thirty five pixels and zero.

02:34.930 --> 02:35.580
Okay.

02:35.610 --> 02:42.630
So what that means is thirty pictures on top and bottom and nothing on the left and right.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.990
So if I hover over you can see the margin there.

02:46.540 --> 02:47.100
Okay.

02:47.190 --> 02:47.670
That's it.

02:47.670 --> 02:50.490
So copy that paste that into there.

02:50.640 --> 02:59.060
And we are done with that save it and then we're going to do the an ordered list element the element.

02:59.070 --> 03:03.840
And this is you have one thing as Mission B padding zero.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.690
So no padding on that.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.680
And that that's it.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.830
So scroll back to here.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.380
Log in.

03:13.380 --> 03:21.570
Text you all like that so that you L. That falls in a log in text elliman paddings 0 and then the last

03:21.570 --> 03:25.830
one to do is just d list item elements the allies.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.170
So click on one of those.

03:27.390 --> 03:32.360
And they're going to say font size.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.710
And I can play around of these values chagny 14 bressant Opened Alferez to find a value.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.190
I like it see I used here.

03:43.190 --> 03:57.020
So it's kind of I think a little bit bigger as do 20 pixels list style type like this and you see if

03:57.020 --> 04:02.750
I scroll down to read through this you can see the bullet point changing in this would be the actual

04:02.750 --> 04:04.280
bullet point that it would use.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.620
So we're just going to say no no we don't need any of those.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.750
See if it makes this disappear.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.990
And then finally just give us some padding.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.840
And then you're used here.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.580
So we are a bit of space between them.

04:22.910 --> 04:23.940
Padding.

04:26.080 --> 04:32.410
Just say no 10 pixels will like maybe 15.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.590
I'll leave it time for now and come back and change.

04:34.590 --> 04:44.230
I actually want to buy anyway copy and paste that in to log in text L..

04:44.240 --> 04:54.160
I like that paste in there and say it and I refresh the page now and should see all this style applied

04:54.170 --> 04:55.000
still.

04:58.660 --> 05:03.260
So the other thing we haven't done is actually give these the check marks that you see right here.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.690
And the reason we haven't done that right now is because in the next video we show you where I get those

05:07.700 --> 05:09.880
I come from and how you can do that.
