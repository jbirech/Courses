A big as welcome back to last time we had our input feels will set up with the style and now we're going

00:05.340 --> 00:10.800
to continue with this and we're going to start by adding some style to this place holder just changed

00:10.800 --> 00:15.190
the colour the moment this graden the very good it's not easy to see with this background.

00:15.390 --> 00:21.720
So the way you change the place hold of an input field a slightly different opening tab and just type

00:21.720 --> 00:27.160
in a place holder colour see SS place holder chalasi Assassin.

00:27.220 --> 00:33.220
Just do a google search for that and you'll find an answer from Stack Overflow to type answer.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.820
The top result which explains it pretty well.

00:36.870 --> 00:42.660
Scroll down to the first answer and you see this user said that there are three ways to do it you can

00:42.660 --> 00:49.170
use pseudo ermine's or you can use pseudo classes or you can do nothing at all different browsers render

00:49.480 --> 00:53.480
their place holder slightly differently and different browsers require different code to do it.

00:53.610 --> 00:58.920
So to change a place of colour for example in Mozilla Firefox version for the version 18 you need to

00:58.920 --> 01:01.690
do it this way Firefox 19 plus.

01:01.710 --> 01:03.770
You do it this way with the to go on.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.940
It's Explorer 10 to 11 you need to do it this way.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.830
Web Kit applies to go.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.210
We do it this way.

01:10.230 --> 01:14.940
So the easiest way rather than me explain it and type all this out is if you come to this question and

01:14.940 --> 01:20.460
copy and paste paragraphs and copy in base code those that are registered does the SS class and you

01:20.460 --> 01:25.860
could be a Ribe of the Imbo container one if you want to make despose in the same areas at a pace that

01:26.260 --> 01:27.900
it just changes colour to everyone.

01:27.900 --> 01:36.720
We're going to use white so just what f f f can't be in base f f f they're there and there and save

01:36.720 --> 01:40.400
that now and we should see and refresh our page.

01:40.770 --> 01:44.220
A white funnel like that they go.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.150
There's your white front in case of that.

01:46.170 --> 01:50.960
That was the easiest way for me to explain it rather than me typing all this out as we as we go it's

01:50.970 --> 01:54.940
easy if you go to that question and copy and paste it and that word user.

01:54.950 --> 01:57.450
If you read the whole and say explains it all quite well too.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.230
So he can explain now far better than I would be able to.

02:00.930 --> 02:05.490
Snacks and movie star the labels which are these parts right here and this is going to be about four

02:05.490 --> 02:06.390
lines of code.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.240
So right click on the label click inspect.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.430
No shortcut.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.190
You do it all.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.210
Click on Arrow then select the label.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.370
It all works.

02:16.390 --> 02:21.100
An inside dare just put colour and irey have a grey colour.

02:21.110 --> 02:27.290
So I truly know what that colour value is so I know it's a 0 8 0 8 0 which is socket grey or colour

02:27.320 --> 02:29.040
and you go that you see.

02:29.150 --> 02:33.500
But if you change it you click on the square and then he can move around with the colours and see what

02:33.500 --> 02:34.660
you like best.

02:34.730 --> 02:42.890
But I know that works well use that for a font size going to be 13 pixels so I get a little bit smaller

02:43.500 --> 02:45.870
then margin.

02:46.010 --> 02:51.110
Top is going to be 15 pixels like that.

02:51.290 --> 03:01.810
Okay and if I copy and paste that and go back to our seats as file and again just per input contain

03:02.050 --> 03:06.910
a label like that and paste that in.

03:07.070 --> 03:07.960
Save it.

03:08.090 --> 03:15.080
Refresh the page you should see that style slide all the label abuse case that they're all about that

03:15.080 --> 03:19.700
slightly smaller font size now in the same font colour too.

03:19.730 --> 03:20.770
So there we are.
