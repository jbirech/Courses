00:00.840 --> 00:02.060
Guys welcome back.

00:02.060 --> 00:03.970
So we're going to carry on with our styling now.

00:03.970 --> 00:06.490
I am going to move on to the burn that is right here.

00:06.490 --> 00:07.960
I'll show you what it's going to look like.

00:08.380 --> 00:11.110
So when we're done it's going to look something like this.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.740
And this is pretty simple.

00:12.910 --> 00:17.800
If you open these Spectre so right click inspect element and then select the button.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.030
So click on this thing right there.

00:19.030 --> 00:23.790
Click the burn like that and we can have the s here so we can see it.

00:23.980 --> 00:34.560
So yes a background colour is going to be transparent background colour transparent where we can say

00:35.060 --> 00:36.620
the border.

00:36.660 --> 00:40.280
She's going to be one Picaxe solid.

00:40.510 --> 00:48.550
And the colour is going to be white so therefore if the border radius which is going to be how round

00:48.550 --> 00:49.780
the corners are.

00:49.780 --> 00:56.710
So the radius we're going to do a fairly large number just but to June 50 pixels like that just so we

00:56.710 --> 00:57.910
know it stays around.

00:57.910 --> 01:04.150
You can change this jab if I'd put a five pixels so five x ray There you see.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.550
The board is only slightly rounded.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.910
Another as I increase it over I press the barrier to increase this.

01:09.910 --> 01:13.550
You see the more I do the more round it gets red.

01:13.780 --> 01:20.450
So we want to be completely round at the corners so just put some large number of whiskers a to 50 pixels.

01:20.560 --> 01:26.020
You don't need to do a number that large I guess but let's just go with that colour which is the text

01:26.020 --> 01:29.570
colour is going to be white on is already white the moment.

01:29.570 --> 01:33.650
But is there to be bit more explicit display.

01:33.790 --> 01:36.400
Block which means he'll appear on his own line.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.910
Nothing will appear alongside it.

01:38.980 --> 01:50.130
Font size font size is going to be a say 14 pixel as Try that letter spacing which is going to be the

01:50.140 --> 01:56.320
spacing between each letter and as you probably guess say two pixels a bit too much Losee one pixel

01:56.580 --> 01:57.870
this is slight gap.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.970
If I change at zero you see how it looks.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.430
See the letters are close together.

02:01.510 --> 02:06.140
If I made that to Windows or now you'll see the letters spaceball about bit.

02:06.210 --> 02:14.380
But some margin on this margin is going to be 20 pixels on top and bottom and then let's say Porto for

02:14.380 --> 02:15.430
the left and right.

02:15.460 --> 02:22.030
And also if you remember me saying before purchasing the centre of its container height we're going

02:22.030 --> 02:30.180
to put 41 pixels like that width is going to be 100 percent.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.830
We won't state the whole with the container again.

02:33.250 --> 02:36.540
And do there's a burn survivor about the here statue.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.440
This one's got slightly thicker border so if things go back to the border right here and change from

02:41.440 --> 02:45.370
one pixel to two pixels or something does go with that.

02:45.370 --> 02:48.440
So copy and paste all this I want to go to to our success file.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.740
So go back to here.

02:50.830 --> 02:58.600
And the bottom just put in foot container and then space.

02:58.630 --> 03:02.570
But since this is all the burns it's the input container is what is our target.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.860
They sign there save it.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.900
We also do something when we hover over the bottom goes at the moment.

03:07.910 --> 03:14.230
If you look at this my cursor know the mouse pointer doesn't change so what I want to do is make it

03:14.260 --> 03:15.950
so it becomes a pointer.

03:15.970 --> 03:20.940
For example if a hover over this button you see the maskers changes to the pointer.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.880
So we don't do that when you hover over it change them out.

03:24.270 --> 03:29.020
And that's really easy copying basis Barbare because I'm too lazy to grab.

03:29.050 --> 03:29.850
Yeah.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.800
So there and then after the burn part do colon hover.

03:34.810 --> 03:36.300
Are going to target the button.

03:36.310 --> 03:44.040
But when it's hovered over so when you hover over it we're just going to say cursor pointer like that.

03:44.050 --> 03:50.470
And now for our freshest page you'll see the magic is a Gaza.

03:50.860 --> 03:51.420
You see this.

03:51.430 --> 03:56.360
The bomb Burns also style and that's it real simple.
