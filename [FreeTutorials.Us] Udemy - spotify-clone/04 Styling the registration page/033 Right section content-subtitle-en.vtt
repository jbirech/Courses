00:00.240 --> 00:01.540
Hey you guys welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:02.530
It's what we did last time.

00:02.540 --> 00:07.560
Just had this little bit of code to make it so that when we hover over this bar here that mouse changes

00:07.560 --> 00:08.620
to a pointer.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.250
So what we're going do now is just work on this part of.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.650
Some text there.

00:13.710 --> 00:18.780
So if I go to my finished version of the site you see that on the right we have this text here and this

00:18.780 --> 00:20.730
is what we're going to be having today.

00:21.570 --> 00:26.710
So go back to your text editor and you show something else as well if you're using a blind text.

00:26.750 --> 00:30.080
You can also do so as you file open.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.780
And then instead of choosing a file you want to open.

00:32.790 --> 00:40.740
If instead you choose the folder so choose my folder that contains my website here Okay so choose a

00:40.740 --> 00:42.830
folder that contains your website.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.760
It will open all of the fires within.

00:44.760 --> 00:50.820
On the side here and that's useful because you can click on it and you can see each file rather than

00:50.910 --> 00:56.040
having to open the new file every single time and you can just click on this by the right and you can

00:56.050 --> 00:59.800
seal all the files in it and modify them from there.

00:59.820 --> 01:05.280
Okay just low trip for you if you use and supplied text so only registers appear to be paid if not already

01:05.280 --> 01:05.920
open.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.610
And one last thing on this.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.940
If you did do this.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.700
If you click on it one time it previews it for you.

01:11.730 --> 01:15.280
If you double click on it it will keep it in the tab for you.

01:15.330 --> 01:21.030
Even if I click on The File now redstart BHP stays there.

01:22.590 --> 01:24.110
So the rest is is to be paid.

01:24.110 --> 01:30.060
Scroll down to the barn and we would add this after our input container gives you access to this device.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.750
Here is where I went at it.

01:31.890 --> 01:37.500
So if I scroll down here I can see that this is did have the closes the input container element.

01:37.830 --> 01:43.050
So we want to add it after here is of hard to find out which div closes which element.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.360
If you go to the top here.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.670
As long as you've indented it properly like this is click on this arrow right.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.610
Then you close it down for you.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.020
See it collapse.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.580
This pile right here.

01:53.580 --> 01:59.070
If I opened it again you see it opens up all this div anyway.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.700
As to the interconnect it is where I want to put this code.

02:01.910 --> 02:04.530
Okay so that's this part here.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.090
And what do you do.

02:06.090 --> 02:15.670
It's actually pretty simple just div and this kind of have the idea of luggin text like that.

02:17.090 --> 02:22.800
And then in there just to h one an fp closing age one time too.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.340
And inside this heading alignment we're going to do get page music favourites.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.930
JS This text as you like right now like that.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.400
Save that and then really have another heading target Tony.

02:36.400 --> 02:42.360
So if you want to use copy and paste that underneath and change this to to be a slightly smaller header

02:42.800 --> 02:51.740
and then here we're just going to put something like listen to loads of songs for free like that.

02:51.940 --> 02:52.660
Okay.

02:52.810 --> 02:56.200
And you see that this pipe here served this part.

02:56.230 --> 02:57.510
How was said in this part.

02:57.550 --> 02:58.870
Others have to do now.

02:59.200 --> 03:06.780
Is this buyer here and the way we do that is we're going to do it list and we just do unordered list

03:06.790 --> 03:08.020
so you L..

03:08.240 --> 03:13.170
Okay so you L stands for an ordered list and this is how you do it.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.640
Bullet point list if you didn't know that.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.930
So inside the U L were going to have L..

03:18.960 --> 03:24.120
I elements okay and these stats aren't for a list item.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.780
You'll see how this works.

03:26.110 --> 03:32.080
But basically every hour we do it is a different bullet point if you want.

03:32.560 --> 03:39.360
So in here we can put whatever you want to do just discover music.

03:39.490 --> 03:43.230
You all fall in love with.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.350
PACE those below.

03:48.350 --> 03:54.050
I think we have three in ours and then one of these was create our own playlists and follow artist keyword

03:54.110 --> 03:54.850
today.

03:55.070 --> 04:03.840
So this can be create your own playlists and then.

04:05.430 --> 04:15.030
Follow test to keep up to date like that and I realize a misspelled that was probably really annoying

04:15.030 --> 04:23.400
some of you praying that I noticed that and then again say that and you see when you go back to refresh

04:23.400 --> 04:25.470
its page it will look great.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.470
But we have the main text we want again.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.400
Now this effort to use your style.
