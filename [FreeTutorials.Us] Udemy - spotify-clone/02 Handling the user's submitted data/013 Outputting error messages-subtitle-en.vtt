00:00.320 --> 00:01.520
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.600 --> 00:04.230
It's that we've pretty much completed our evaluation functions.

00:04.230 --> 00:08.970
It's time to actually do something with those hours because at the moment we create areas if their input

00:09.000 --> 00:09.940
is invalid.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.930
But we don't actually do anything with it yet.

00:11.940 --> 00:16.600
So now going actually output this to the user so they can correct their mistakes.

00:16.620 --> 00:23.610
So what we want to do in registered up HP we will be outputting the error messages next to their respective

00:23.610 --> 00:24.220
field.

00:24.270 --> 00:28.870
For example if the first name has a problem with the output the error message by the first name field

00:29.610 --> 00:34.590
so we get to create a function in a count of HP is a real small function.

00:34.590 --> 00:38.080
And all this wonk's is going to do is check to see if we have any errors.

00:38.190 --> 00:41.000
So underneath the register function we can just create in of the function.

00:41.010 --> 00:45.260
Good public is going to be look because we're going to call this from out of our class.

00:45.600 --> 00:54.660
So a Public Function get error and this is going to take a parameter which is just going to be the anthraces

00:54.660 --> 00:56.390
to look for in the error.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.160
So you can just pull this error if you like.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.440
And like I said real simple all this focus is going to do is check the error rate in this class to see

01:04.440 --> 01:07.060
if that error message we pass in exists.

01:07.060 --> 01:07.390
You'll see.

01:07.400 --> 01:15.180
I mean now so we can say if not remember the exclamation point not in the score array.

01:15.220 --> 01:23.120
So in underscore array and inside there put error because this is what's going to look for the array

01:23.130 --> 01:32.820
it's going to look for in is this error array like that and what the enery function does is it just

01:32.820 --> 01:36.760
checks to see if the given parameter exists in this array.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.770
So we're checking to see if error exists in error.

01:40.020 --> 01:47.550
And if it doesn't because this is not Remember So if it doesn't we can just change the error to an empty

01:47.550 --> 01:48.270
string.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.610
So researching something.

01:49.620 --> 01:54.310
So we might pass into this and maybe we pass in this.

01:54.310 --> 01:58.160
This current base is passed into the array like that then looking for this.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.790
And if it doesn't find it it will set this to just an empty string.

02:01.800 --> 02:09.000
And you see why now the very last line of this rule is going to do return in a similar fashion so span

02:09.750 --> 02:19.680
class equals error message like that close are spun off and then put closing spanton on there are now

02:19.710 --> 02:21.510
and should be a slash at the front of that.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.710
So this is what your closing tag looks like.

02:24.150 --> 02:28.510
And inside of that span tag which is good but our error string.

02:28.530 --> 02:32.520
So just put error like that and that's it.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.550
So now here we have to use single quotes because of way early inside of a string.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.110
If we use doublecross there it will end the string.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.860
See how this is outside of the string now.

02:42.150 --> 02:46.290
So if you're using quotes within string you of course have to use single quotes.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.460
And so that and that should be it for that function.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.900
So all this is checked to see.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.250
The area we pass in is in the array.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.070
And then reassemble.

02:57.070 --> 03:02.440
Just go back to read stoppage B class and this is where we output the messages if there are any.

03:02.500 --> 03:11.050
So above the label tag pre-package P blocks remember call X mph be code by Echo account which is the

03:11.050 --> 03:20.560
variable we created up here so I can count arrow get error by that K which is the function we just created.

03:20.560 --> 03:26.890
But if you mean we need to add a parameter to this so we're going to check for a certain error message.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.200
This is for the user names are going to get to a where you did the username validation here and validate

03:32.280 --> 03:35.670
username and this is their error messages will be pushing into the array.

03:35.680 --> 03:41.470
If there's an error with the user name so just copy that and paste that in there like that.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.440
Let's see that work before we go and put the others in there let's go see if that works.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.690
So this error message is send the user they must move to 5 125 characters so we're going to go and submit

03:49.690 --> 03:55.230
this form now with our username which is less than 5 characters and we should see in our message.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.740
So I use an agent a letter to fill all this in.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.520
I now fill this in now.

04:01.540 --> 04:07.010
Put a password in there and click sign up and we should hopefully see an error message.

04:07.300 --> 04:12.250
Whose names were between 5 and 25 characters obviously revellers style this yet so ignore the fact they

04:12.270 --> 04:15.970
have his on the same line when we style this will look nice in.

04:16.150 --> 04:16.960
But for now this is good.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.540
This is what I want to get going.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.030
If I were if I refreshes page the message goes away of course.

04:22.030 --> 04:25.500
So that's we know it works now it's just a case of going through and putting those in for everything

04:25.510 --> 04:25.860
else.

04:25.900 --> 04:32.130
So just copy where I've done that and how here is do we have the first name so first name and last name

04:32.140 --> 04:35.830
we only have one error message that can possibly be up.

04:36.790 --> 04:38.970
So put that in there.

04:39.100 --> 04:44.130
Put that in there we go and many to change these error messages now so for the first name the message

04:44.140 --> 04:45.340
is like this.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.420
So Copy that.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.860
And paste it here.

04:51.030 --> 04:53.570
Like that and the last name.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.730
Like that.

04:59.610 --> 05:00.790
A storm there.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.690
NATO these neat.

05:02.690 --> 05:05.090
You need to check for the exact same message.

05:05.100 --> 05:13.920
So if for example I changed this for some reason I changed it to 26 characters and I forget to change

05:13.920 --> 05:14.980
it here.

05:15.020 --> 05:18.540
It's still going we're looking for the 25 character their message so it won't find it.

05:18.540 --> 05:22.890
So you need to make sure that this matches the one you have that you're checking for.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.420
So this needs to match that.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.100
Exactly.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.160
Once we get this work in our show a better way of doing this and what we'll do is we'll store these

05:31.160 --> 05:35.880
strings somewhere and we'll just call a reference to a string so we'll only have this string stored

05:35.880 --> 05:38.630
in one place in it in a separate file.

05:38.640 --> 05:43.110
And it means that if we have a change if we were to go and change over us they were well out for an

05:43.110 --> 05:43.930
hour show then.

05:43.950 --> 05:44.820
In the coming videos.

05:44.820 --> 05:46.530
But for now just do it like this.

05:46.550 --> 05:49.220
And remember these need to be exactly the same.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.170
They need to match what you have here.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.110
So that's a username first name and last name.

05:54.110 --> 05:55.620
Does let's do the same for e-mail.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.540
Thank you email.

05:56.550 --> 06:00.900
We have two of them and we will eventually have three because we have things to do here but for now

06:00.900 --> 06:02.930
we have two error messages possible.

06:03.090 --> 06:12.030
So paste one page two and then the first woman check and four is your emails don't match.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.620
Paste that in there.

06:15.990 --> 06:19.280
The second one is email is invalid.

06:22.430 --> 06:25.470
Okay and then password we have three.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.910
So I'll copy paste both of those.

06:28.450 --> 06:34.750
And we're not going to the addresses by that confirm email because we only do have it next to one we

06:34.750 --> 06:37.060
don't need them by both of them.

06:37.220 --> 06:43.330
So above password is put those email sent We knew a third one so copy and paste one more and then changed

06:43.330 --> 06:50.080
them into the password error messages sent from the password validation function and copy those.

06:50.230 --> 06:58.030
Copy this one to and then finally copy this one and then that is it.

06:58.060 --> 07:03.580
We are done so now when you submit your form.

07:03.730 --> 07:06.550
If there are any errors within me just say this.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.010
You will see if we don't correctly.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.650
Some some nice error messages.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.990
So let's go put up a username.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.120
It's too long this time.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.160
I think 25 cats it has got to have 25 characters.

07:18.370 --> 07:24.790
Our first name that's less than Deum our characters and same with email.

07:25.140 --> 07:31.560
I'll put an email that passes the validation of the text field I talked about but without the dot com

07:32.060 --> 07:33.650
I do the same here.

07:36.540 --> 07:41.970
In fact I will make sure they match a password.

07:42.210 --> 07:50.150
Is going to be a bunch of question marks because it shouldn't lay in case of not an alphanumeric character.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.620
Actually I make sure they match as well.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.400
One two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven.

07:56.770 --> 07:57.550
Okay.

07:57.780 --> 08:03.840
So let's see what we get so used MASC between 5 and 25 characters because we had one letter in there.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.910
Same for that last name.

08:06.120 --> 08:12.560
Same for that e-mail is invalid because it did we didn't have to dot com all over the place were counting

08:12.570 --> 08:16.100
numbers or letters because I had a password that only had question marks.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.240
Okay so let's put something else in there.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.960
That is phil. he's in our do a valid email but I'll make it.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.810
I make it so they don't match.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.960
It's their.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.250
So they don't match search should Pretty's a different area now.

08:32.610 --> 08:38.420
And now do passwords that don't match that you only contain alphanumeric characters.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.900
So sign up.

08:40.140 --> 08:46.320
See emails don't match and passwords don't match and so they're That's where our checks are working

08:46.950 --> 08:51.180
so the next thing we should probably do is you know how when you submit this form when your values go

08:51.180 --> 08:56.160
away we can make it so remember that the value you had never fauzi works title out again.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.380
So I think that would be a good thing to do next.
