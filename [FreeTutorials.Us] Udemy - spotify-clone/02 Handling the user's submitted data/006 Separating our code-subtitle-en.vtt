00:00.240 --> 00:01.420
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:05.940
So last I read these three functions up here which sanitize our data for us.

00:06.210 --> 00:09.960
Now we're very drastically do something with that data before we do that.

00:09.990 --> 00:13.940
We're going to just separate this page up a little bit and make a little bit more organized.

00:14.020 --> 00:18.470
The moment appears quite long with all these functions in these handlers right here in violation of

00:18.470 --> 00:19.310
our code.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.570
This would only grow if we continue doing everything on one page.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.810
So we're going to take this whole PSP blocks around from the very first line down to the closing of

00:27.810 --> 00:29.750
the HP tag right here.

00:29.850 --> 00:35.430
Copy that or kirti I should say and create a new file so command then control n you've got a Windows

00:35.430 --> 00:41.190
machine or just go to file new file and then paste will end there.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.290
And we saved this in here but we're going to create a new folder.

00:45.300 --> 00:49.080
This is our route folder is see there's you register bagian you next page.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.730
So us create a new folder in here.

00:51.750 --> 00:56.220
This code includes code and you follow that.

00:56.310 --> 01:00.930
But then we create one more new form of inside of the includes folder so includes folder click new folder

01:00.930 --> 01:05.480
again and then it's going to be handlers save that.

01:05.580 --> 01:08.070
And then within the service file into the handles folder.

01:08.460 --> 01:16.980
So save it as Register handler doppie HP of course you free to call ever you want to answer call and

01:16.980 --> 01:19.080
register handle up HP and save it.

01:19.080 --> 01:26.820
Like I said in the handling folder and took safe go that and that message and just go and you get this

01:26.820 --> 01:27.400
mÃ©tis.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.390
Poppy quite a lot from supplying techs but asking you to buy a licence but this click cancel or go and

01:33.390 --> 01:34.610
buy a licence.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.860
So this page I hear is going to handle our register form submission.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.440
That's why we call it register handler.

01:40.500 --> 01:46.860
So this log in here doesn't belong in this page so cut that occurring and make a new file just while

01:46.860 --> 01:49.800
we're doing this but create a new one for the logon handler too.

01:49.950 --> 01:58.450
So we have to create new BHP tags so thp and then close you HP dies off inside there just paste that.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.030
OK.

01:59.050 --> 02:03.090
And would I do anything with that code right now so just save this file madjid done with this for a

02:03.090 --> 02:03.610
little bit.

02:03.720 --> 02:09.990
So in the same folder the handlers folder saved this as luggin handler on page bit.

02:10.420 --> 02:10.850
Okay.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.790
And like I said we're done with this for a bit so you can even close out different.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.650
We only log in hambly.

02:16.410 --> 02:21.150
So they go we have a dedicated file for the register forms submission.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.470
Now we need to make sure we reference this with the moment I register page doesn't know anything about

02:25.470 --> 02:28.860
that form so we can add a reference to that file.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.550
Like so open gageby tags.

02:33.350 --> 02:37.650
And inside there which can say include this.

02:37.670 --> 02:41.120
This is going to be the link to the file you want to include in the page.

02:41.150 --> 02:47.070
So we say include and the folder was called includes slash.

02:48.110 --> 02:49.060
Handlers.

02:49.310 --> 02:50.480
Slash.

02:51.210 --> 02:55.770
Register handle doppie HP.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.080
Just like that.

02:59.620 --> 03:03.120
And you know you've got this right because when you save this and our bills are safe for us to have

03:03.140 --> 03:08.860
that BHB when you say and refresh the page if you see an error it's probably an error saying that you

03:08.860 --> 03:10.140
can't find the file.

03:10.540 --> 03:14.550
So refresh this or then I don't see any errors.

03:14.650 --> 03:18.490
So if I couldn't find your file you'd have an error message at the top saying they can't find it.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.360
So if you don't see anything you know it's worked.

03:20.470 --> 03:27.310
And what include does it basically takes this whole file and copies and pastes a code into your page

03:27.370 --> 03:28.540
when the website loads.

03:28.660 --> 03:36.400
So saying include this file is exactly the same as if you just took all this text and use Harry all

03:36.400 --> 03:40.030
appear like that because that's essentially what it does.

03:40.040 --> 03:45.760
One when this page is loading it very first thing it does goes to this file here takes all the code

03:45.760 --> 03:49.270
from there and paste it into your page.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.690
Yes you do that obviously.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.830
But that's essentially all it does.

03:53.210 --> 03:53.590
OK.

03:53.620 --> 03:58.840
And the last thing about this include I tell you is that it starts in whatever phone you're in so we're

03:58.840 --> 04:00.910
in the registered iph P file.

04:00.910 --> 04:05.030
It starts from whichever folder they're registered up HP file is in.

04:05.350 --> 04:09.940
And if you look at our files to a chair we have rested up to be far which is where we are now that our

04:09.940 --> 04:14.650
current location and that's why we started with include because just from there we go into the includes

04:14.650 --> 04:15.320
folder.

04:15.630 --> 04:15.990
Okay.

04:16.030 --> 04:16.810
And that's it.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.350
That's really all there is to it.

04:18.350 --> 04:21.000
It is a bit more organized.

04:21.190 --> 04:25.680
You can see instead of all that BHP kotite Now we just are 80 malco.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.480
So here we'll just do the log in hambly as well.

04:28.480 --> 04:34.320
Like I said we are doing anything with logging handler yet but you can just include that too while we're

04:34.330 --> 04:39.770
here so don't forget and give us a front just make sure there's no errors when you refresh the page.
