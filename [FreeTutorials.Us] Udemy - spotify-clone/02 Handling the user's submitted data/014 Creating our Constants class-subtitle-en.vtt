00:01.170 --> 00:02.430
Guys welcome back.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.040
So now that we have our error messages out incorrectly.

00:05.250 --> 00:10.260
I said we're going to make the form remember your values so that if you improve your e-mail for example

00:10.310 --> 00:14.790
and there's a problem with it you won't have to start from scratch in interpreting again it will remember

00:14.790 --> 00:16.730
your value from the previous submission.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.480
Before we do that though we're going to fix one problem and briefly addressed in a last video at the

00:21.480 --> 00:23.480
moment with the error messages.

00:23.490 --> 00:29.010
If you make a small change to this you have to remember to go and change it in in the register handler

00:29.040 --> 00:31.500
class on the edge of each class.

00:31.500 --> 00:38.420
I mean because they use names you look for must match exactly with the user name you put into the area.

00:38.790 --> 00:44.050
So we're going to fix that because the best way to do it would be if this only existed in one place.

00:44.070 --> 00:47.320
So that way if you made change we wouldn't have to go and change it elsewhere.

00:47.450 --> 00:49.140
It's a really simple thing to do.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.660
Just create a new class so new file.

00:51.810 --> 00:52.810
Click save.

00:53.020 --> 01:00.750
And we can save it in the classis folder so includes classes and then save it as a constant stop BHP

01:00.780 --> 01:02.800
Constance with an open case.

01:03.470 --> 01:04.390
Okay.

01:04.410 --> 01:12.210
Click save and our kreeger page pre-tax and then inside that class constants.

01:12.500 --> 01:12.940
And that's it.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.780
There's no constructer in this class.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.240
So this is kind of all we need to do.

01:17.430 --> 01:23.710
This is going to contain all of our message strings so we can just say public static.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.910
Explain what this means in a minute let's call this.

01:27.390 --> 01:31.310
Passwords do not match.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.360
Equals.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.990
And then this is going to be the rest for a passwords do not match.

01:37.990 --> 01:41.430
So go into account our BHP and go validate passwords.

01:41.570 --> 01:44.870
And this is the this is the is for when your passwords don't match.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.690
So passwords do not match.

01:46.850 --> 01:47.400
Right.

01:47.540 --> 01:51.230
And what this does this public means is available from outside the class.

01:51.310 --> 01:54.810
The static means you don't have to create an instance of the class first.

01:54.830 --> 01:59.800
What that means is with Account class when we are into called the functions for example when we when

01:59.800 --> 02:03.870
we would call the register function we have to create an instance of the Account class.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.240
Right.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.960
This account equals new account like that.

02:09.120 --> 02:14.950
That's that's called Creating an instant with static functions in a static members we don't have to

02:14.950 --> 02:16.960
create instances of those classes.

02:17.110 --> 02:22.780
So you'll see how that works when we use it before and just copy and paste it again probably have a

02:22.780 --> 02:26.350
bunch more time because we have all these error messages we have put in there.

02:26.420 --> 02:30.020
So let's go with it on the passwords one copy and paste this.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.910
And this is for password contain names of letters.

02:36.190 --> 02:48.130
So let's call this one password not offer a numeric cellphone America's What do the checking for pay

02:48.130 --> 02:50.090
say in our next one.

02:54.840 --> 02:59.500
Speyside the next line down passwords must be between 5 and 10 characters.

02:59.660 --> 03:03.050
So can you say password.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.250
Characters.

03:06.810 --> 03:11.590
Okay next one email is invalid Constance.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.180
Next one down.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.450
E-mail is valid.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.170
E-mails don't match.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.780
Yes yes in there.

03:28.390 --> 03:34.750
All this e-mails will split right emails do not matter.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.060
A date.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.190
Last name.

03:41.340 --> 03:43.040
You can do is call this.

03:45.430 --> 03:52.640
The last name carried two is the same for first name.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.790
First name characters.

04:05.770 --> 04:08.230
And finally the user name.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.000
Pace.

04:12.010 --> 04:17.120
Then there are four user name characters.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.960
I think that's it for now.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.540
We of obviously we do have these two checks we still need to do.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.830
So we'll have two more our messages to output.

04:24.930 --> 04:28.190
But for now that's to get rid of these last three women too many.

04:28.440 --> 04:36.180
And that's the case now instead of manually typing the string in we can get it from here.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.990
Can you share the word now.

04:38.370 --> 04:45.100
So firstly we have to include this constans file to go back to registers up HP at the top underneath

04:45.100 --> 04:46.140
the.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.350
This part we're going to include classes.

04:49.410 --> 04:58.110
It should be punsters stop HP in this will our stressfully use it and then the accounts class instead

04:58.110 --> 05:07.050
of inserting this string here are actually going to insert constants in double colon and then what do

05:07.050 --> 05:11.790
we call it for the username e username characters.

05:13.460 --> 05:20.430
So where we're here they'll assign username characters to Sly that this is how we're going to call it.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.460
But that's also how to check for it.

05:22.460 --> 05:25.760
So I we check for that error message instead of checking for this.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.930
We'll check for this.

05:28.670 --> 05:34.750
So in both cases when insur And when we try and look for the error we're checking for the variable and

05:34.760 --> 05:37.460
the variable points to this.

05:37.520 --> 05:43.550
So if we change this now to six characters or twenty six characters then we won't have to go on a date

05:43.550 --> 05:44.810
anywhere else.

05:44.810 --> 05:47.770
So already is a much needed a way of doing it.

05:48.680 --> 05:53.850
So just to make sure that worked before you and all the others will just check it out here.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.810
So do a username that's too small.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.180
Fill these in.

06:01.490 --> 06:04.170
See there's a message.

06:04.190 --> 06:09.320
So now this is a case of going through and completing those for the rest of them.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.600
So same thing here.

06:14.350 --> 06:18.210
Constance colon Caroline and the double colon by the way.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.200
Just like the Arrow.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.120
So when a register handler we use an arrow to call the function.

06:22.210 --> 06:27.220
The arrow is when you have an instance of the class whereas double cones when you don't have an instance

06:27.250 --> 06:28.380
because it's static.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.870
This is static.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.580
We don't need to create an instance of this class to use these.

06:32.890 --> 06:33.340
Okay.

06:33.400 --> 06:39.200
That doesn't mean that you don't worry about dialect confuse you or we need to know is if the functional

06:39.270 --> 06:40.270
memory is static.

06:40.270 --> 06:42.990
We use this double koan to call it.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.950
So we changed all of these now.

06:47.690 --> 06:57.310
First name characters of first and characters and copy that put it in to read see stood up HP.

07:00.460 --> 07:05.210
There is a saying for last name counters.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.790
Copy and paste that and I would just call that last name.

07:09.810 --> 07:14.350
Practices change after last name characters.

07:15.270 --> 07:16.790
Same here.

07:20.160 --> 07:27.000
Man this is going to be emails don't match which seems do not match.

07:27.200 --> 07:34.160
So replace the name of that copy and paste all this and put it into account of HP as well.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.870
Your e-mails don't match.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.910
Next one is e-mail is invalid.

07:37.910 --> 07:46.850
So pay samier changed the name to email invalid account the HP email invalid copy that.

07:48.270 --> 07:50.040
Paste in here.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.620
Okay next one is and is your passwords don't match.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.150
Paste that in there.

07:55.160 --> 08:06.940
Change this to passwords do not match their copy of S and paste it in here as well.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.730
Two more to go.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.440
So paste this there.

08:10.440 --> 08:20.250
This is the one for them and critters so passwords now from Iraq a site that copy this is a bit repetitive

08:20.250 --> 08:27.280
I know but bear with me nearly done and one more there.

08:27.660 --> 08:36.570
And this is going to be password characters password characters and then finally put that in here as

08:36.570 --> 08:37.060
well.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.720
And that is it.

08:39.720 --> 08:44.000
So no different result for a visual perspective it does exactly the same things it did before.

08:44.020 --> 08:49.380
But this is a much cleaner way because we're no longer checking for the strings manually We are using

08:49.380 --> 08:54.330
their static numbers which contain no strings which means if we do ever one to make change to the wording

08:54.330 --> 08:58.620
slightly or having to change the message at all then we have to do in one place now.
