00:00.340 --> 00:01.590
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.390
So what we did last time is just implement this Constance class which just made it a little bit easier

00:06.390 --> 00:11.070
for us to maintain the messages that we output while we're going through now is something I mentioned

00:11.100 --> 00:17.770
briefly a couple of videos ago which is to remember the values of this form when you submit.

00:17.820 --> 00:23.100
So if for example if I submit this form and I have the user name isn't valid and it doesn't successfully

00:23.100 --> 00:28.950
register it's going to bring us back to this page is it shows the messages it would be nice if it remembered

00:28.950 --> 00:32.350
the values you entered last time so he wouldn't have to re-enter it again.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.180
So we're going to do that this video and said really really simple.

00:36.180 --> 00:45.600
All you do is add a value to these improv elements because you see for example if I added a value to

00:45.600 --> 00:46.590
this embellishment.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.760
So help save that.

00:49.800 --> 00:55.750
You'll see that we have the value inside the embattlement like this.

00:56.070 --> 01:01.800
So we want to do is just put whatever they entered last time into this string right here.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.960
And how do we get the value.

01:02.970 --> 01:05.770
Well if you look in register handle add up to SB.

01:05.820 --> 01:10.390
We take the values from the form using these post with the square brackets.

01:10.410 --> 01:13.280
So this is the value that they entered.

01:13.530 --> 01:17.790
So we need to do is put this variable into the value.

01:17.790 --> 01:22.630
So we do a lot less because p p variable we the page p tags in there.

01:22.770 --> 01:25.290
So inside the value double quotes.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.500
Page p tags like that.

01:27.630 --> 01:35.250
And then just put echo and then does assign in a score post square brackets single quotes and then whatever

01:35.250 --> 01:36.640
the name is of this field.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.500
So this is use a name like that.

01:39.650 --> 01:40.510
Right.

01:40.980 --> 01:45.260
And so in a very long and close the page p tags off.

01:45.330 --> 01:51.570
The problem with this you see right now is that this isn't always set if we haven't submitted the form.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.850
It would be an error in there you'll see right here.

01:53.850 --> 01:59.230
This is actually an error our parade is going to say something along lines of undefined index username

01:59.250 --> 02:03.000
because we haven't actually submitted the form yet so this didn't actually have a value.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.340
But you'll see if I do submit this form so I'll release.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.930
You'll see that once we submit this.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.810
Okay I'll make sure the master match.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.820
So you see.

02:22.870 --> 02:25.040
If Remember the valley from last time.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.230
But if I just refresh its page now goes away because it isn't.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.470
And this is no longer set.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.280
So what we do is only use this if it's been set.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.590
Now a very simple way to do this is instead of putting this up there you just create a very short function

02:39.590 --> 02:40.230
of here.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.290
Really simple.

02:41.420 --> 02:49.330
Just say the function get input value like that right in this area.

02:49.340 --> 03:00.710
Take a name it should be the name of the input and we can just do this if it is set sign and the score

03:00.800 --> 03:04.790
post and then this would be the name

03:07.190 --> 03:14.380
then echo to our sign the school post with name and that is it.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.410
That's the function.

03:15.410 --> 03:18.470
So now what this does is it takes a name.

03:18.470 --> 03:24.340
So for example your name of your field for example using names a name user name.

03:24.620 --> 03:30.480
And usually we do something like does underscore post and then use a name like that don't we.

03:30.590 --> 03:31.900
But spelled correctly.

03:32.030 --> 03:33.340
Now we're just passing this.

03:33.350 --> 03:39.560
Use this name pas into this function like that and we put it inside the post roble like that.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.010
So you'll see we call this function on copy paste the name of the function.

03:43.130 --> 03:49.760
And I'm going to go back down here and then we're just going to say inside the page p tags like that

03:50.310 --> 03:54.080
we'd have to echo anything just just at present inside the function we are correct.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.670
So we don't need to echo like that.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.630
So get em to a value.

03:58.730 --> 04:05.770
And then I just put the name of this input field which in this case is even a name like that.

04:05.780 --> 04:08.970
Now this will only use a value if it's been set.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.590
So refresh this page.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.940
The error goes away.

04:12.110 --> 04:19.220
But if I give this value they submit this from.

04:20.890 --> 04:21.870
He's there.

04:21.980 --> 04:27.660
He says you'll see this time around it remembers this so we don't have any more messages.

04:27.670 --> 04:32.210
And the journey it takes the value if it's been set so that's it.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.290
I told you simple it's really really easy.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.760
So I'll just copy and paste this again and we'll put it until these ones now.

04:37.790 --> 04:42.600
So value and this is going to be the first name.

04:42.790 --> 04:47.290
Remember taking the name part and now we have the name exactly the same as the idb.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.200
You don't have to do that.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.090
So paste it into there.

04:52.090 --> 05:01.170
And this one's going to be the last name and then will paste this one in here in the mail and this one

05:01.180 --> 05:05.730
is going to be e mail to that.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.090
And we're not going to do it for passwords.

05:07.090 --> 05:08.400
We all remember those.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.120
And then that's it.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.200
So let's refresh this page and fill in the form.

05:13.210 --> 05:14.970
She remembers the values there.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.350
It reads like that.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.310
And then Kenny.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.780
I mean and there.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.950
I make sure these passwords don't match.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.160
So we get to see the error messages.

05:28.170 --> 05:28.570
There.

05:28.590 --> 05:31.980
So it's rumbaed all these values and then we have a message.

05:31.980 --> 05:36.440
And if if there's something wrong with this we could just correct it now.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.750
But that's it.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.540
That you really is simple.

05:39.690 --> 05:42.830
And if you reverse the page you get start over.

05:43.110 --> 05:48.250
So when you submit the form it remembers values when you just refresh the page it goes away.
