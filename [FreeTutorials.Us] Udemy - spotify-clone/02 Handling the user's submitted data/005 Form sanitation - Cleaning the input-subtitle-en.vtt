00:00.430 --> 00:01.650
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.830 --> 00:07.150
So last time we are showing you a little demo of how we can recognize when one of the buttons is pressed

00:07.160 --> 00:09.410
So for example our register Burns pressed.

00:09.510 --> 00:14.780
Nothing you do is show you how you can actually get the values that users put into these text boxes.

00:15.030 --> 00:20.130
Obviously with the Redstone form we want to take the user name first name last name or this and say

00:20.130 --> 00:21.240
I would do that.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.950
If you scroll down to where you created You're a steam a steam elements.

00:25.050 --> 00:30.300
You see we have these name attributes here in the name too which of what we use to access the data in

00:30.300 --> 00:31.590
the text areas.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.190
So for example to get a user name use this name equals usernames.

00:35.220 --> 00:42.720
Copy that scroll up to our block here for when the register Burns pressed not a log in one.

00:42.750 --> 00:47.970
And it brings the buttons pressed and will create a variable in BHB which is done with the dollar sign

00:48.000 --> 00:50.410
so we can say user name.

00:50.430 --> 00:57.350
So if you see a dollar sign that means it's a variable same in some other language you might have seen

00:57.520 --> 00:58.660
far Great ever.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.070
So my looks then like your VaR username.

01:01.330 --> 01:01.910
OK.

01:02.150 --> 01:03.780
Or some languages.

01:03.840 --> 01:10.130
You say the type So you'd say lock string user name in dhp you just say a dollar sign.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.730
There's no other word than that.

01:12.210 --> 01:18.580
So a great username variable and this is an equal dollar sign and the score post.

01:18.910 --> 01:23.940
And inside the square brackets you put the names the name in my example was using him so I'll use that.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.270
And just to show you a word that I actually echo which Remember that means print username.

01:29.280 --> 01:35.440
Now if I go back to here across the page and I will actually submit this form.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.050
So it's our race.

01:39.200 --> 01:46.050
Can you go for some other values in an active member these need to be filled in for it to actually submit

01:46.050 --> 01:47.440
the form.

01:47.440 --> 01:57.660
So in the past where did the matter WHAT it is and click sign up and you see at the top airco the username

01:57.750 --> 02:02.450
the value because I'm using a field which was access like this.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.030
OK.

02:03.070 --> 02:04.850
And this is really that simple.

02:04.890 --> 02:07.090
That is how we get new data from the fields.

02:07.090 --> 02:10.220
Now we do is process the data.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.410
So we have to make sure it's clean and I'll show you what that means very soon.

02:13.470 --> 02:19.030
But we have to look at processing the data before we can insert it into the database.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.640
So get rid of this Ekers block right here.

02:21.640 --> 02:26.790
And this show the couple of things we we're going to do to the user name to make sure we're happy with

02:26.790 --> 02:27.320
the way it is.

02:27.320 --> 02:34.390
Before we send it to the database so we're going to do this type username again so exactly the same

02:35.600 --> 02:39.410
and three equals drip.

02:40.260 --> 02:45.290
Tax strip tax is a psap function and I'll show what that means in a minute.

02:45.300 --> 02:51.950
Use the name so Strip tags strips all the extra amounts that might be within a string.

02:51.960 --> 02:59.280
So if a string if there if they put this in the username and some decks maybe but they also put something

02:59.280 --> 03:05.370
like this like a burn or something like that sized elements it will get rid of these cases we don't

03:05.370 --> 03:09.290
want them to eliminate him elements to the database because people can manipulate your site.

03:09.300 --> 03:13.130
They can essentially insert their own elements to your page.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.290
So we stripped down.

03:14.310 --> 03:16.620
But we're going to do something similar.

03:16.620 --> 03:23.990
One more thing is user those same variable equals ustr and a score of place.

03:24.210 --> 03:29.890
So string replace and replace all spaces so do double quotes.

03:29.900 --> 03:34.370
Space comma and then empty quotes.

03:34.440 --> 03:41.020
So in two single grates there and the third round just use your name.

03:41.040 --> 03:46.470
So what is going to do is look for all the spaces that appear in his name and replace it with an empty

03:46.470 --> 03:47.150
string.

03:47.250 --> 03:51.960
This string replace function takes webs in the first round to find all occurrences of this.

03:51.960 --> 03:58.410
So if we if we did a Replace All the curtains would be they would take every single A find the place

03:58.410 --> 03:59.210
it would be.

03:59.430 --> 04:04.680
We're going to take every single space we find in their name and replace it with an empty string.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.060
Nothing.

04:06.060 --> 04:10.840
That means if they enter a username like this it will get replaced.

04:11.230 --> 04:12.690
And that can we don't them.

04:12.690 --> 04:15.310
Some men use names with spaces to base.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.960
And that's all the sanitising we're going to do for these in them.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.740
So we're going to do the same for the rest of the values for first name last name.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.000
So you can essentially copy and paste this again.

04:25.010 --> 04:27.320
So what username is this space underneath.

04:27.580 --> 04:34.290
Do this for first name like that and the name for first name of call the first name.

04:34.350 --> 04:41.310
Take your name put in there for post first name and the place or the user name variables here with a

04:41.460 --> 04:42.490
first name.

04:42.990 --> 04:47.630
I'm going to do one more thing with this which is just uppercase the first letter of the string.

04:48.090 --> 04:51.710
So you can just say first name the equals.

04:51.720 --> 04:59.510
You see first name the function you see first is all in lowercase and then inside that but S.T. are

05:00.240 --> 05:02.060
to lower.

05:02.460 --> 05:05.390
And then in side they're to a first name.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.410
So this will uppercase the first character so they enter this for their name that the first character

05:12.440 --> 05:17.190
would be a case and then it being set its data into a database like that.

05:17.270 --> 05:23.480
So this part in the middle though s TR to lower string to lower converts all the string to lowercase

05:23.510 --> 05:28.940
first reason we're doing that is because if we didn't do the string to lower part and they entered this

05:29.210 --> 05:34.310
with an uppercase C maybe like that the first carriage would be a case that would be left with that.

05:34.310 --> 05:39.990
So before we were case first character we make all the rest of the string lowercase circle circumvent

05:40.090 --> 05:43.640
all cultures lowercase and then we have became the first character.

05:43.860 --> 05:45.070
Mister what that is.

05:45.350 --> 05:46.480
And that's it.

05:46.550 --> 05:50.570
We basically do that the same for the rest of the fields.

05:50.790 --> 05:55.450
But instead of doing this for every single one we could copy and paste this for every single one so

05:55.450 --> 05:57.810
I do the same for last name email.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.840
But we'd be repeating a lot of the code.

05:59.990 --> 06:05.240
So to say this repeating code that's something we don't want to do we can just create function at top

06:05.250 --> 06:06.530
of the disease for us.

06:06.530 --> 06:14.510
So create a function which is something we can call over and over again and call this sanitize form

06:14.770 --> 06:17.420
using name brackets.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.610
It's going to take one parameter which is input text.

06:21.680 --> 06:27.980
If you haven't done functions before bed with this because you learn about functions as we go from just

06:27.980 --> 06:32.990
by doing this so even if you don't understand what fonz's are yet no doubt you'll learn about these

06:32.990 --> 06:34.070
as we go.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.240
And if you really want you can go and look it up online there's loads of resources for it but you'd

06:38.240 --> 06:42.710
be finding carry on and you'll you'll understand how these work just by doing these examples so bear

06:42.710 --> 06:44.560
with it even if you don't know what this is.

06:44.990 --> 06:51.470
So we've created this what's called sanitized form username and you can basically copy and paste these

06:51.470 --> 06:54.050
two lines here.

06:54.290 --> 07:01.220
So put them inside there and then input text is the text we're going to be performing their sanitisation

07:01.240 --> 07:02.200
on.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.180
So we will take whatever they whatever they pass into this function.

07:05.190 --> 07:11.780
We know strip the dog's And then we're going to replace all the spaces with an edgy character and then

07:11.780 --> 07:19.970
just return input text by that and why we've done that is now instead of having those lines built over

07:19.970 --> 07:27.210
the years and then we can just call this functions with that name we call the function like this size

07:27.230 --> 07:29.900
form user name and in brackets passiveness.

07:29.990 --> 07:34.430
So instead of having all those that those that are having like three lines below user name which we

07:34.430 --> 07:39.430
just had we now only of the warn and we could do the same for the rest of the string.

07:39.430 --> 07:45.710
So copy and paste this function is slightly different for username because we don't uppercase the first

07:45.710 --> 07:50.300
character but change the user name to string.

07:50.300 --> 07:56.250
This would just be a generic string sanitisation one as opposed to a username sanitisation function.

07:56.390 --> 08:02.710
So these are strings out ization function and we can basically copy those lines from below those three

08:03.240 --> 08:07.570
right and then put those in there and to keep the return part.

08:07.910 --> 08:14.240
Keep the return impact text and copy in place and replace first name with input text.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.320
All these places and that's it.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.450
So three forms.

08:20.690 --> 08:27.260
So the sartaj form string function and the same as usernames stripped down and replaces their spaces

08:27.260 --> 08:28.990
with the empty character.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.970
They also posted the first letter and now we can just call this function in a similar way.

08:34.970 --> 08:35.830
Brackets.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.850
That and get rid of that.

08:41.890 --> 08:46.000
Now is down four lines at least for every single field.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.360
We can just have the one line for all of them.

08:48.420 --> 08:58.050
So the do last name here last name and this is going to be last name what else is there.

08:58.050 --> 09:04.980
There's our email so you can just call this email and this can be email.

09:05.000 --> 09:05.860
I know I know.

09:05.930 --> 09:08.090
I remember the names that we used for these.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.880
This would be emailed to me because remember I have two of them.

09:10.920 --> 09:18.600
For them to control and every now and then two more lines for password password is going to be its own

09:18.600 --> 09:20.790
functions can be very similar.

09:20.790 --> 09:25.340
It's just a very short once I copy one of these does matter which is create a new function.

09:25.340 --> 09:30.240
This is going to sanitize form password and this is a simpler one.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.050
All we do in this is just strip the tags.

09:32.070 --> 09:35.780
We don't replace any spaces or anything because they can have spaces in their password if they want.

09:36.060 --> 09:36.840
And that's it.

09:36.840 --> 09:41.220
So we have a new function sometimes one password which only strips detax.

09:41.520 --> 09:41.830
OK.

09:41.910 --> 09:48.990
So copy and paste the name of the startime form password function and was set to do the same thing as

09:48.990 --> 09:50.210
you did above.

09:50.760 --> 09:58.260
So password equals sanitized form password and in brackets just docusign and the score post you could

09:58.260 --> 10:06.000
just copy and paste this I know but we type it out to password like that and copy and base out one line

10:06.000 --> 10:12.210
below in issuing the password to and then you go just like that we've cleared the data and it's in a

10:12.210 --> 10:17.790
very neat inefficient way because without doing the functions this way we have had all of these lines

10:17.790 --> 10:19.310
repeated for every single input.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.890
So this is a much neater way of doing it much more organized way.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.340
So that's it.

10:24.360 --> 10:30.410
We now handle the flon submission and we clean the data now ready to actually do something with it.

10:31.050 --> 10:35.190
So if you want to go and test it out you can go back to here type something in.

10:35.190 --> 10:36.580
Doesn't matter what.

10:40.500 --> 10:45.160
Just fill it just fill these out space where there's no errors when we submit the form.

10:45.570 --> 10:47.320
OK.

10:48.050 --> 10:49.630
So you shouldn't see anything.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.560
No our message is hopefully there.

10:51.620 --> 10:56.130
So the fact we didn't see anything is good if we saw a billion messages in here that's for you know

10:56.210 --> 10:57.090
be a problem.
