00:01.510 --> 00:02.710
Hey guys welcome back.

00:02.710 --> 00:08.770
So last time we separate our register handle the code from our registered page be page and the same

00:08.770 --> 00:09.830
for logging handler.

00:10.090 --> 00:13.280
Just make things a little bit easier to work with a little bit neater.

00:13.330 --> 00:18.910
Now we've done that we can actually continue with our registered burn handler actually prepare to insert

00:18.910 --> 00:20.910
the data into the database.

00:21.010 --> 00:27.030
So I'm just quickly going to remove the spaces between these just so keeps things together.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.520
And we're going to mention space underneath that.

00:29.830 --> 00:34.850
So there's a bunch of checks me doing these things for example which change the user name is long enough

00:34.850 --> 00:41.230
for their first name is long enough that the emails match to each other their passwords match the password

00:41.250 --> 00:43.950
then contain a cast down to contain.

00:44.050 --> 00:47.830
So yeah there's a bunch of checks which you do on these things so we're going to do this stuff right

00:47.830 --> 00:52.390
here and we're going to create functions that do this for us instead of run all the code in this space

00:52.390 --> 00:52.980
here.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.880
All right functions here we'll just call the functions very similar to how we did here with the sanitized

00:57.880 --> 00:59.130
functions.

00:59.320 --> 01:06.010
So underneath these functions here we'll create our validation functions which is going to validate

01:06.010 --> 01:09.470
the input so function.

01:09.510 --> 01:17.230
This can be validated username like that validate the user name and it's going to take a user name.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.750
So you can just you end if you want user name right.

01:21.780 --> 01:30.270
And actually copy that copy paste that and this will validate first name first name.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.870
And this can just be the first name.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.830
Same thing for last name.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.680
So eveillard Day last name.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.170
This can be 11.

01:41.370 --> 01:46.110
And then we only have to offer to create here the moment it's going to be one is going to be validate

01:46.200 --> 01:56.680
emails e-mails plural e-mails because we have two e-mails moments here and then comma and do two and

01:56.680 --> 01:59.690
then the last one is it for me for the passwords.

01:59.920 --> 02:08.400
So copy basically validate e-mails one is give me validate passwords passwords and what can be done

02:08.410 --> 02:12.010
with a password and then double you too and that's it.

02:12.010 --> 02:18.340
Now we should call those functions to copy the name of the Valar that username function and down here

02:18.350 --> 02:23.330
just call it and pass in user name like that.

02:23.860 --> 02:24.390
Okay.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.960
Copy and paste that I made.

02:27.970 --> 02:30.110
We have one two three four five.

02:30.240 --> 02:36.580
So one two three four five and just take the names of these file name.

02:36.580 --> 02:43.530
This is be first name change the variable to first name then move our date last name right.

02:43.570 --> 02:46.570
There are changes to last name.

02:46.570 --> 02:55.150
Validate e-mails and change this to our email and email too.

02:55.610 --> 03:01.810
OK in the last one involved a password validate passwords like that and then.

03:03.020 --> 03:07.310
Password and then password too and that's it.

03:07.310 --> 03:12.530
We call all of our nation functions call obviously they have a thing in them yet but we've called them

03:12.800 --> 03:17.550
and we don't want to do anything with them so these won't return any things around to get any data from

03:17.550 --> 03:22.790
then we'd have to do something like resolved because the result of this call because there will be no

03:22.790 --> 03:23.320
result.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.840
So we don't have to actually do anything with the we just have to call these because all these functions

03:27.840 --> 03:33.740
are going to do is check that they're okay if they're not it's going to insert some error messages into

03:33.830 --> 03:34.530
an error message.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.650
Ray I will explain that now you'll see how that works as we go.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.600
But that's all we need to do for now.
