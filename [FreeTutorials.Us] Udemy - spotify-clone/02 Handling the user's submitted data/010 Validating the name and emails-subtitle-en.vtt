Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:08.100
So last time we even started writing the usually bad days in function we left a to do because we haven't

00:08.190 --> 00:11.530
actually set up by using day we can't check if the username exists.

00:11.550 --> 00:17.030
We'll come back to that part but we'll just copy and paste this part of the validate username function

00:17.130 --> 00:22.470
and paste it into the valet first then unveiled their last name function because we're going to do the

00:22.470 --> 00:23.640
same thing there.

00:23.670 --> 00:29.520
So copy and paste into there and then for the valdai first name we will make sure the name is not less

00:29.520 --> 00:33.180
than two characters because a change is this error message.

00:33.180 --> 00:40.790
To your first name must be between 2 and 25 characters right.

00:40.790 --> 00:44.160
And do the same sorting below for the last name.

00:44.160 --> 00:55.070
So to your last last name must read between 2 and 25 characters but we also need to change the parameters

00:55.080 --> 01:01.200
because now we say u.n. units in this function and we just change it to offend F and there and there

01:01.230 --> 01:06.400
and this one is L. and so copy that paste l.a. and then Ellen just like that.

01:06.620 --> 01:10.170
Ah and that is all the validation will to do for the first name and last name.

01:10.170 --> 01:16.920
There's nothing to do there so I just remove it from space and that and the first that they first name

01:16.930 --> 01:18.710
by last name front is are done.

01:19.080 --> 01:24.380
So we only have two more functions to do and us the validate emails and Monday passwords 1 so validate

01:24.390 --> 01:24.830
emails.

01:24.850 --> 01:33.930
We're going to do three checks so the first one is going to be if he is not equal to each to is real

01:33.930 --> 01:34.350
simple.

01:34.350 --> 01:34.760
If the U.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.980
If the e-mails leave entered aren't the same.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.710
We're going to copy and paste this array pushpa.

01:41.510 --> 01:49.110
And just change the message to simply your emails don't match.

01:49.130 --> 01:52.420
Just like there and then return.

01:52.950 --> 01:55.630
I get that one of three jacks done.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.110
Second chair were going to do it just to make sure it's in the correct format.

02:00.170 --> 02:04.240
So if not which is a summation point.

02:04.280 --> 02:11.770
So if this is not true filter and the score var and just copy out I'll explain this once.

02:11.810 --> 02:20.990
Once I've typed it up I am in the second around to have that function is 0 cups filled in a score valid

02:20.990 --> 02:21.810
day.

02:21.960 --> 02:30.330
Oh valid date and the school email filter and the score validate and the school email I like.

02:30.390 --> 02:33.300
But what this does.

02:33.500 --> 02:39.620
This checks whether this is in the correct format so this is this knows what format and email should

02:39.620 --> 02:40.120
be in.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.500
And it checks if if e am.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.800
The variable is not in the correct format.

02:47.060 --> 02:52.970
Then we can just copy paste those two lines of both paste in there and change this error message to

02:53.810 --> 02:56.830
email is invalid.

02:57.020 --> 02:59.860
Just like that and then return as well.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.470
Get some of you might be wondering why we need this.

03:02.480 --> 03:09.410
Because if you look at the email feel itself you see time equals email and you probably think in there

03:09.410 --> 03:14.390
that means that it will check it out for us so fresh is that there are messages.

03:14.390 --> 03:17.330
Last time I missed the first page.

03:17.580 --> 03:27.400
And yes all of you are thinking that the typed email stops us from entering a string.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.130
This not only now.

03:28.130 --> 03:32.930
So if I try submit this you'll see that it does allow submit the form it says Please include an at in

03:32.930 --> 03:33.650
e-mail.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.150
So the problem is only checks for an at will have a text afterwards.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.660
Okay if I don't have that text that would still know it's invalid but if I have a little weird text

03:41.660 --> 03:46.460
after it thinks that's a valid email so the form submitted.

03:46.460 --> 03:52.190
The reason is because technically you don't need the dot com or anything parvin email the extension

03:52.870 --> 03:54.860
for it to be an invalid email.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.210
Technically this is a valid email.

03:58.400 --> 04:05.210
So we need to check manually ourself that is valid and what this check headers make is make sure that

04:05.210 --> 04:11.720
it contains the dot com part Duckery k whatever is all right so this just basically is a second check

04:11.720 --> 04:13.490
to make sure it's a valid email.

04:13.490 --> 04:17.030
So the last thing to do is just to check that the email hasn't already been used.

04:17.060 --> 04:22.020
And like I said earlier would actually have the uses table set up yet so we can't do that yet so we'll

04:22.040 --> 04:32.470
just say to do check that username has already been used.

04:32.950 --> 04:34.060
Okay and that's it.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.010
So so far we've done the user name the first and last name on emails.

04:38.030 --> 04:41.420
Obviously we do have some to dos here but we'll come back in days later.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.990
The only thing left to do is give out their passwords one.
