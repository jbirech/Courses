00:00.310 --> 00:01.600
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.860 --> 00:06.990
So now that we've done the valet functions for all of these you know they use name first name last name

00:06.990 --> 00:07.750
in e-mails.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.480
We're going to do for the passwords now.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.180
That's the only function left to do.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.500
And it's going to be three checks in there again.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.650
The first check is very simple just to see if they're the same.

00:16.830 --> 00:24.170
So just like we did with the e-mails we can say if p.w. is not be good to be you too.

00:24.240 --> 00:30.330
Just like that and then copy and paste this are a push bar on the return or type but again if you really

00:30.330 --> 00:35.590
want then just change that to your passwords don't match game.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.390
There's a first check then two more to go.

00:38.760 --> 00:45.540
The next check is going to be if it contains anything other than alphanumeric characters often americathis

00:45.540 --> 00:51.940
are letters and numbers of extends any punctuation exclamation point to a thing we don't know that.

00:51.960 --> 01:02.610
So if Prag and the score match and this matches a pattern you'll see in a minute jazzers follow along

01:02.620 --> 01:04.720
and use arcs when this wouldn't have typed it out.

01:04.770 --> 01:06.360
And this pi is going to be the pattern.

01:06.540 --> 01:12.130
And the second priority is going to be this PDB your password variable.

01:12.210 --> 01:18.750
So we're basically saying if password matches this pattern then do this and the pattern will a match

01:18.780 --> 01:20.010
is the following.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.960
It's a little bit complicated at first glance so it's probably best to just watch me type it out first.

01:24.970 --> 01:26.530
Now explain afterwards.

01:26.580 --> 01:33.750
So slash square brackets remember Arab word that we use for exponentials and then we're going to uppercase

01:33.810 --> 01:42.930
a dash uppercase Z like that and then lowercase a dash lowercase dead like that.

01:42.930 --> 01:50.520
And then simply zero dash nine and then close out square brackets off and then one more forward slash.

01:50.840 --> 01:59.220
And what this is saying if password matches this expression and expression is not this hour here is

01:59.220 --> 02:05.830
not so not a to z A to Z lowercase or 0 to 9.

02:05.850 --> 02:12.940
So this is saying if it's not within this range if it's not within a to z uppercase Ave that lowercase

02:12.960 --> 02:17.880
8 0 0 to 9 it's obviously contains some other characters which you don't want to accept.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.840
So if that is true then we're going to do a similar sort of thing.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.550
Ray push should be the return.

02:24.650 --> 02:37.360
So Rapere SH and changes to your password can only contain numbers and letters.

02:37.470 --> 02:38.110
Perfect.

02:38.130 --> 02:43.770
And then the final check to do is just to check whether the length of the password is suitable.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.860
And we've really checked for the length in the first name in their last names.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.240
You could use a copy that you want.

02:48.260 --> 02:51.380
We're going to similar sort of a statement and paste that underneath.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.140
So I just copied that from the very first name from qiam.

02:54.210 --> 03:02.880
We change the parameters to Peter where you and Peter were here and we can change that to 30 and then

03:02.880 --> 03:05.160
that can be five for every day.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.770
Change it to whatever length you want to use.

03:08.010 --> 03:14.340
And then so if it's not then we're going to say your last word.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.900
The third.

03:17.970 --> 03:21.920
Go five 30 characters.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.960
And that is it.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.560
That's over their passwords.

03:25.730 --> 03:26.140
Done.

03:26.310 --> 03:31.290
If you're wondering why we're not checking for password two it's because we checked the very first job

03:31.290 --> 03:34.710
we do is to check whether a password and password two are the same.

03:34.950 --> 03:38.740
If they're not the same we won't get to this park as we return.

03:38.910 --> 03:39.390
Okay.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.980
So if we get to these parts we know the password is the same which is why we don't have to check password

03:44.010 --> 03:46.000
to jacking password one is enough.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.370
Because like I said they're both the same.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.410
And that's it.

03:49.410 --> 03:50.630
The Valiants was motion.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.770
There's all our validation functions done with the exception of the two days which I mentioned before

03:55.920 --> 03:57.820
but that's a very good start.
