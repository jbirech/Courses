WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:00.870
As a go.

00:00.990 --> 00:05.880
Last time we created our register form so now we have both our log in form and our registered form on

00:05.880 --> 00:07.020
this page.

00:07.020 --> 00:10.240
What we're going to do now is just a brief interruption to BHP.

00:10.260 --> 00:16.630
So at the top right above the HP email tag makes from space and then going to open up a p-h people OK.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.850
And we do that like this.

00:19.710 --> 00:24.600
So those tags create a page people log in all up here Pekoe can go inside of here.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.850
So anything on each page on your website.

00:26.970 --> 00:29.080
You can just put these BHP blocks.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.290
It doesn't matter where you put these.

00:31.380 --> 00:34.240
As long as you put that out in there you could put some BHP anywhere.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.930
So I could put it down here for example.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.380
Don't copy this just show works.

00:38.450 --> 00:39.520
Echo.

00:40.230 --> 00:41.040
Hello.

00:41.040 --> 00:41.910
I like that.

00:42.190 --> 00:44.770
And I can do that.

00:45.150 --> 00:46.970
Save it for the page.

00:47.110 --> 00:51.680
And you see hello there because all echo does is a PSP term for print.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.700
So this just prints something to the screen.

00:53.860 --> 00:54.330
Okay.

00:54.510 --> 00:57.500
So I'll just remove that and go back to the top here.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.180
So I would have the same page p code in here.

01:00.180 --> 01:04.920
All you do is write a code that detects when our log bone is pressed.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.400
So we're going to do an if statement.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.040
Okay.

01:08.160 --> 01:17.050
And inside the prentice's we're going to say if it is set parentheses again dollar signs underscore

01:17.070 --> 01:25.710
post in all capitals square brackets single quotes and then inside here is the name of the input so

01:25.710 --> 01:26.940
the name of the bone.

01:28.220 --> 01:31.140
So we're going to say laurian burn which is the name remember.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.190
So log in.

01:32.270 --> 01:33.690
Copy the name there.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.740
Paste line.

01:34.850 --> 01:40.690
So if is does underscore post inside square brackets locking button.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.220
But the argument has to go inside single quotes as well.

01:44.220 --> 01:48.470
And this is saying if the log in Burton has been pressed do something.

01:48.590 --> 01:58.000
So if it has we're just going to say airco again but was pressed like that.

01:58.120 --> 01:58.420
Right.

01:58.420 --> 02:03.760
So when I press this page you won't see anything because the log in and hasn't been pressed.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.960
If I press like no member off to fill these in because it required fields process log Amber and now

02:09.980 --> 02:12.090
you'll see log in and was pressed.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.200
So that's how we're going to know that they've submitted a form they've tried to log in.

02:16.220 --> 02:21.470
They tried to register so nice inside here you can leave a comment if you want.

02:21.470 --> 02:26.940
By doing two slashes he can just say bargain button was pressed.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.350
Maybe helps you understand what's going on.

02:30.410 --> 02:34.220
I'm going to do another one for the register button and copy and paste that.

02:34.390 --> 02:39.890
Now this is going to be the register button.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.570
Changes to register if you want.

02:41.830 --> 02:46.570
So Register phone was pressed and in here you can just just make sure it works.

02:46.670 --> 02:50.170
The register was pressed.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.180
Save that refresh.

02:53.180 --> 02:57.440
When you try and refresh a form you get a confirmation dialogue or pair asking if you want to reset

02:57.560 --> 02:59.800
for resubmit the form.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.020
This is a browser thing.

03:01.030 --> 03:05.820
It is not a problem but I'll show you a way round this so that that doesn't happen later on.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.120
For now don't worry about that.

03:07.220 --> 03:11.220
Just first a page we have to know about that is if you did.

03:11.330 --> 03:17.050
If you did click confirm on that dialogue it would just resubmit the form with exactly the same values

03:17.060 --> 03:18.290
you submitted it last time.

03:18.340 --> 03:22.420
Okay so it's not a problem at all but I'll show you how to get around that later on.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.160
So we're going to add some values into here.

03:25.160 --> 03:29.660
Now none of these are required fields so in order to test it that button works we have to make sure

03:29.660 --> 03:30.920
they all have values.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.290
So just give them some values.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.600
Click sign up.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.370
Because these are our type email.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.690
You see our former Here we have for the e-mail inputs we have time equals email.

03:42.800 --> 03:51.000
It's expecting an at sign like that person thing and then it was for us.

03:51.100 --> 03:55.670
Now sign up and you see register burm was pressed.

03:55.910 --> 03:56.730
Okay great.

03:56.740 --> 03:57.090
That's it.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.780
So that's it is a very brief introduction on unpatched B.

04:00.830 --> 04:03.970
You won't need much more of an introduction because you'll learn it all as we go.

04:03.980 --> 04:09.430
So even if you've never seen or heard of page B before you'll be absolutely fine in this course.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.080
Don't worry.
