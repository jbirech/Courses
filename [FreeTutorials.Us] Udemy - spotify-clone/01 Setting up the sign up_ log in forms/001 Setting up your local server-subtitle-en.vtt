00:00.550 --> 00:02.340
Edgar guys who work the course.

00:02.400 --> 00:07.130
Let me take the time firstly to thank you for rolling in this cause and secondly to let you know that

00:07.140 --> 00:10.400
if you run into any problems along the way as you move through this course.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.420
Just let me know.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.270
I'm here to help.

00:12.270 --> 00:17.910
So if you have any issues or bugs or you're not working just ask me a question or send me a message

00:17.910 --> 00:20.820
and I'll get back to you within a couple of hours.

00:20.850 --> 00:24.420
It's also worth noting that this is not an introduction to h.t. email course.

00:24.450 --> 00:29.280
And all I mean by that is while we do go over the basics particularly at the start of the course we

00:29.280 --> 00:33.030
don't go over them in this same amount of detail as you would find in an instruction to programming

00:33.030 --> 00:33.550
course.

00:33.630 --> 00:34.050
OK.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.930
So all that means is if you've never program before.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.430
Just ask me some questions if you need some more explanations.

00:39.450 --> 00:43.650
Are we happy to spend as much time as you need going through things with you and the very last thing

00:43.650 --> 00:47.150
before you get started with this is just when you feel the time is right.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.780
If you could leave this course a positive review I'd really really appreciate it because as instructors

00:51.780 --> 00:54.120
the positive reviews are all we have to go off.

00:54.270 --> 00:57.340
So I'm really really thankful for all the positive reviews I get.

00:57.550 --> 01:00.290
Okay well I've said everything I need to say.

01:00.510 --> 01:01.700
Let's get started.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.090
So we get started now.

01:04.320 --> 01:10.640
The first lecture is the most boring one we just have to set up our web server and our text editor.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.940
This is the only time in the course you have to actually download things and set things up so just bear

01:14.940 --> 01:16.140
with me through this video.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.940
And after that we'll be onto the good stuff.

01:18.690 --> 01:21.950
So the first thing to install is sublime text.

01:21.990 --> 01:25.770
This is just so a text editor and you're free to use any text editor you want.

01:25.770 --> 01:28.160
If you have a favourite in mind.

01:28.200 --> 01:35.490
Maybe you use like using Notepad you can use any text editor you want but this is a very typical programming

01:36.000 --> 01:38.690
text editor particularly for h.t. AML.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.730
So this is a very good one to go with.

01:40.830 --> 01:45.150
So if you just google a blind text and click on the first link you will take you to this website and

01:45.150 --> 01:48.370
you can just click download on a Mac so it's faux sex.

01:48.390 --> 01:54.590
But you know it is available on all operating system so you have no problems with that.

01:54.630 --> 01:57.340
So I've already downloaded it so I'm not going to click save.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.900
But the set up is pretty simple so I want you to run you through that.

02:02.700 --> 02:08.390
So this is what the text looks like at the moment it just looks like a blank screen is not much to it.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.160
You just like to type code.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.760
And that's really all you need to know.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.440
It's a really simple thing.

02:14.450 --> 02:22.020
Okay so the next thing will be install is our web server and the web server just allows us to test our

02:22.020 --> 02:25.820
code locally without having to buy hosting or anything.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.040
Okay so just type in Zambia just like that.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.710
Because that's the name of the website we're going to use and click on the first link.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.180
From there you will see the difference.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.850
Our brain system is available on so go ahead and click yours.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.220
Like I said I'm on a Maxo outlook this one.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.010
And then you should see the installer appear.

02:47.310 --> 02:51.650
So click Save I'm saying that whatever you want I have already downloaded it ahead of time.

02:51.660 --> 02:58.300
Just try and speed things up a little bit so I won't say it again but once you've saved that.

02:58.890 --> 03:04.590
Open it up and click on the file you just downloaded and that will start the installer.

03:05.490 --> 03:10.880
So on a Mac it looks like this obviously looks slightly different on your operating system.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.300
So just go ahead and open that up.

03:13.350 --> 03:16.750
I need to add to my password with just a password for my computer.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.700
But you may or may not need to do this.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.540
Go ahead and click okay.

03:27.030 --> 03:28.540
And you see the wizard appear.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.280
And this is pretty simple.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.130
Just click through.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.860
Like I said it looks slightly different if you are on a Windows operating system or something but for

03:34.860 --> 03:36.770
the most part it is the same.

03:37.020 --> 03:43.350
Okay I think on the windows one you have a bunch of different things you can install down here but just

03:43.350 --> 03:48.600
leave the defaults and then click next and then click next again.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.660
It will install.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.450
Like I said I really install this way we actually do this.

03:53.460 --> 03:56.470
But click next and it will begin the installation.

03:56.820 --> 04:00.750
So once you have that install you will go ahead and open it up so go to location that you installed

04:00.790 --> 04:04.570
at siamak it would be in applications most likely.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.480
And scroll down to stamp down.

04:07.800 --> 04:14.490
Open that folder and then you have this right here in a Mac it's called manager OSX but it might because

04:14.520 --> 04:16.690
something slightly different for you.

04:16.690 --> 04:22.110
Maybe our control plan is something and this is the eigen so double click on that and you tend to add

04:22.110 --> 04:23.420
password again.

04:27.910 --> 04:29.680
And then you see it's opened.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.430
Here we go.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.080
So there's really not much you need to do here.

04:34.110 --> 04:36.620
Just go across to on a Mac anyway.

04:36.630 --> 04:46.090
Manage servers and make sure that my skewl database is running an Apache web servers running okay on

04:46.100 --> 04:47.150
a Windows computer.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.190
If I remember correctly there's a there's a couple more options here.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.850
You have files ala Mercury a tom cat.

04:54.120 --> 05:00.100
But all I need to do is make sure Apache is running and then my obscure old database is running again.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.000
So just Bob Apache as well.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.400
Everything else you could ignore.

05:03.450 --> 05:07.790
These may or may not be running when you start for the first time but most likely they're not.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.760
So just hit start on them back on them start again.

05:10.970 --> 05:11.750
That's it.

05:12.090 --> 05:16.000
Leave that running Don't close down anything and check it worked.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.800
You can just go to any browser just type in local host like that.

05:20.950 --> 05:26.010
Just type in local host and you should hopefully see a screen similar to this.

05:26.010 --> 05:29.400
If you see a screen with a bunch of languages underneath just click on your language.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.430
It should take you to this screen if you dont see this.

05:32.430 --> 05:35.330
It means that you don't have the set up correctly.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.880
Okay but just by having them running you should see this.

05:40.310 --> 05:41.720
And that's it for us do it.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.080
That's all the insulation you need to do throughout the whole course.

05:45.350 --> 05:49.350
So we're going to write a very quick test page now to make sure that works.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.490
Open up a blind text which is our text editor.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.880
You just download it.

05:53.270 --> 05:58.100
Go out and say that and we're going to save that to the location that you installed your web server

05:58.100 --> 06:01.360
too so go to wherever you just saved azam too.

06:01.490 --> 06:06.600
So in my case applications zantop and h.t. docs is the Foley one.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.450
80 docs is where all your web page is going to go.

06:09.550 --> 06:09.860
OK.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.670
Because when you type in local host it takes you to this folder.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.000
OK.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.220
Logo's you just a go to this folder.

06:15.710 --> 06:18.690
So you're going to create a new website in this folder.

06:20.080 --> 06:28.960
So inside a detox folder and a quick new folder and give a name for your project on and call it slots

06:28.960 --> 06:34.410
of Fi that Spotify and click create.

06:34.450 --> 06:39.340
So I've got quite a bunch of websites in here but you can see the slifer website I've just created.

06:41.090 --> 06:46.800
And then we have save this file in there as Index Doc BHP.

06:48.230 --> 06:49.970
KS your first bid to be file.

06:50.060 --> 06:56.920
Click save and the good thing about cymbeline is it can auto complete for you as you're typing.

06:57.110 --> 07:04.700
But we can just type in htl and click tab and it fill in the structure of a basic AIST email page OK.

07:04.910 --> 07:05.830
And to check it worked.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.900
We're just going to.

07:07.370 --> 07:09.010
Hello right there.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.030
Save that mystery save it.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.730
Go back to your web browser.

07:12.740 --> 07:20.840
Type in local host local host and then slash web your folder was called for your website.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.730
So I called it Spotify going.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.740
Hit enter and you should see hello which is why we had in here.

07:27.800 --> 07:34.550
If you see that it works and it is a very very brief introduction into a teaser for those of absolute

07:34.550 --> 07:35.630
beginners.

07:35.630 --> 07:39.650
The body section right here is where all your content is and go free website.

07:39.680 --> 07:47.380
The head section between these two is where you going to say what jobs get files to include or what's

07:47.380 --> 07:52.340
the files which you are storing files and inside this title tag right here.

07:52.340 --> 07:57.450
We can say I've gone too far to fly or whatever you want to put.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.350
And you see that that appears in the tab right here right there.

08:01.430 --> 08:04.120
Okay so whatever you type in the title tag appears here.

08:06.050 --> 08:10.100
So that was just a very quickly your action to the h.t. Email structure for those absolute beginners

08:10.100 --> 08:12.020
out there and that's it.

08:12.020 --> 08:18.310
So in this lesson we stored our text editor our web server and we write a little test page and we know

08:18.330 --> 08:19.460
works.

08:19.490 --> 08:23.520
Remember if you have any problems at all with this just write me a message I usually respond within

08:23.540 --> 08:24.610
a couple of hours.

08:25.190 --> 08:26.000
So that's it.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.360
That's actually all the insulation you need to do throughout this whole course.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.120
So you've made it through the boring part.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.720
Now onto the good stuff.
