WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:01.320
Hey guys.

00:01.470 --> 00:06.630
So last summer we did as we installed our webs installed so blind text which text editor.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.420
And now we're ready to make a start.

00:08.580 --> 00:13.640
So what we doing now is create our register page and it's going to be whether users sign up or log in.

00:14.040 --> 00:19.110
But just quickly before I do that will explain something about this index page for those you don't know

00:19.480 --> 00:22.810
the index pages the default page website goes to.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.470
So for example if you go to your local house and you type in you go to your website to get to your index

00:28.470 --> 00:33.570
page you could type indexed BHP or you could leave off this index up here.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.960
You don't have to add that because by default if you don't specify a page it will go to your index page.

00:39.120 --> 00:39.530
OK.

00:39.780 --> 00:41.440
So this is something we're quick to know about.

00:41.670 --> 00:49.080
The index page leaving the indexed page out of the URL is exactly the same as if you did that.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.810
You don't have to include it.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.210
So with your head now qurei our registered iph age.

00:56.670 --> 01:04.550
So you really have to open up a blind text and then you save this and save it into the folder wherever

01:04.560 --> 01:12.170
you're zammit Web server is h.t. Docs and then find your website you created.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.610
So this forms called slot's find this example.

01:14.640 --> 01:20.580
So there's our index of a.p. page we created last time was going to save this in the same place.

01:20.690 --> 01:26.570
So Register doppie HP this in the same follows of red as the index page.

01:26.850 --> 01:33.130
And remember you can still see e-mail press tab and you get the e-mail structure and we can just write

01:34.150 --> 01:38.390
to something like that where you want it now.

01:38.700 --> 01:44.100
And just to make sure it works this is just our age.

01:44.360 --> 01:51.420
And as I go across and make sure that worked so hard just go to the register page paper make sure you

01:51.420 --> 01:53.890
spell it right.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.920
This is a case so we know we have the right page.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.550
Great.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.870
And when we get right into it so we get rid of that now.

01:58.890 --> 02:00.810
Now we know it works.

02:00.890 --> 02:07.740
And just create a div So you have it just right div and press tab like that because like I said last

02:07.740 --> 02:10.620
time supplying text auto completes for you.

02:10.620 --> 02:16.410
So if you type the name of a tag and then press tab it will auto complete it for you if Usenet extended

02:16.410 --> 02:22.170
that didn't autocomplete obviously just write that out manually it will give this div and I gave it

02:22.230 --> 02:29.570
an identifier and the idea is going to be in that container just like that one word.

02:29.570 --> 02:36.060
And for those you don't know what these things are divs and I.D. there's a good chance you'll understand

02:36.060 --> 02:41.040
what they mean just by doing this so the more we go through this course you will get a very good understanding

02:41.040 --> 02:42.020
of how they work.

02:42.270 --> 02:46.680
But if you still don't understand you can just do a quick Google search.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.470
There's so many resources out there to learn this from.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.080
Or ask me a question and I'll answer it.

02:52.410 --> 02:58.380
So inside this div form tied a game games for one press tab and complete it for you.

02:58.650 --> 03:06.240
And this form is to have the idea of log in form a form is basically how we send dates to another page

03:06.990 --> 03:13.700
so action is going to be registered up HP which is the page run now.

03:13.710 --> 03:16.920
This action part is what page you want to send the data to.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.180
So we're going to send it to the page.

03:18.180 --> 03:24.810
We are currently on which is ready to appear to be an F for peak calls post.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.510
This is just the method in which the data is sent.

03:27.630 --> 03:33.290
You will use post for this whole course so you won't ever do anything other than post for this cause

03:34.100 --> 03:34.730
than inside.

03:34.740 --> 03:39.900
Here we're going to put an H to tag and the H tags headers.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.690
You have h one age to age 3.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.480
The number corresponds to the size of it.

03:44.610 --> 03:45.870
You'll see how that works now.

03:45.930 --> 03:52.380
We'll put the log in to your account.

03:52.560 --> 03:58.350
Save that and we'll go back to here and just make sure we're seeing this refresh this page and you should

03:58.350 --> 04:00.540
see all the into your account.

04:00.570 --> 04:01.810
This is a slightly larger fund.

04:01.800 --> 04:08.010
This is your age to tack so I will carry on going to an input to set out in a press tab and you get

04:08.010 --> 04:08.470
this.

04:08.550 --> 04:09.900
There's only one tab for this.

04:09.900 --> 04:15.150
You don't have a closing input so you won't have this sort of thing you get that with input.

04:15.270 --> 04:16.360
You only have to 1.

04:18.160 --> 04:30.180
Eidy Equals Let's call this luggin a user name just like that name is going to be just in username again.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.680
Name is how this is of reference how I can get the data from this field.

04:34.690 --> 04:37.300
You'll see how that works soon.

04:37.300 --> 04:42.700
Type it calls text like that which is the type of input we're going to put in this field.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.970
This is a text box to save that we'll see how it works.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.530
You'll see there's a text box on this field that you can type into.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.960
But we also give us a place holder so there's an app.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.370
This is an empty box at the moment.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.050
When you give it a place hold now so type place holder.

04:58.050 --> 05:03.520
He calls and we can say e.g. Bart.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.190
Simpson like that or something.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.490
First page.

05:09.890 --> 05:13.440
Then you see a place holder now and then when I type in this it goes away.

05:13.450 --> 05:17.080
I mean and last thing.

05:17.230 --> 05:21.770
Just put the required like that.

05:21.830 --> 05:25.870
This means it won't let you submit the form unless this has a value because we always want the username

05:25.870 --> 05:27.240
field to have a value.

05:27.590 --> 05:35.320
OK so copy that whole input and just make this full screen so you can see Obis you copy the whole input

05:35.320 --> 05:41.140
line and paste it in below and this will always change the user name.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.460
This is going to be password like that.

05:44.680 --> 05:51.040
Okay copy that paste it and then we don't want a place holder on the password field because we don't

05:51.280 --> 05:56.320
have a suggestion for that so it's a sleeve lever place holder out of that and also change this type

05:56.350 --> 05:58.920
people text to type password.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.670
Because let me show you real quick if we had text typed it was text.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.890
So use your second field here.

06:03.910 --> 06:07.120
If I had type it was actually we had to see it your password as you're typing.

06:07.170 --> 06:10.240
But if you change it to type because password.

06:11.830 --> 06:17.920
You'll see that when I type in their hidden hidden or seeing that these actually appear on the same

06:17.920 --> 06:21.790
line and we obviously don't want that we want them to appear on separate lines so we could use a bit

06:21.790 --> 06:23.630
of CSI s to do that it be really easy.

06:23.650 --> 06:31.570
But what we're going to do is separate these even further into their own components so we can have a

06:31.570 --> 06:37.030
paragraph tag right here and those who don't know the paragraph tags always appear on separate lines

06:37.180 --> 06:39.300
just copy and paste is a quote Don't copy this.

06:39.310 --> 06:43.200
Just watch to see that 5 2 paragraphs tags like that.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.100
There are literally separate lines.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.330
See several I did out of here next to each other.

06:47.470 --> 06:52.290
So we're going to use the paragraph tags now to make our input superior to separate lines.

06:52.360 --> 06:59.670
So get your paragraph tag and move one of these inputs into there like that.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.600
Now do the same for this input.

07:01.690 --> 07:07.850
So Create Your paragraph tag copy the password one into that and you'll see just by doing that.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.740
They now pay our separate lines.

07:13.250 --> 07:19.210
And then the very last thing we're going to do is put a label tacked a type label pressed tab and the

07:19.210 --> 07:22.440
label is just going to be easy for you to see how this works.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.780
I just write a user name.

07:24.670 --> 07:30.250
You also write for copy and paste that into there.

07:31.480 --> 07:35.230
Save that you show share outlooks.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.640
And you see we have a label next to our textbooks now.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.530
So we'll do the same thing for passwords so that type of label press tab password.

07:46.990 --> 07:52.080
And then for copy paste that into there.

07:52.570 --> 07:55.930
And this four attribute has to correspond to the I.D..

07:56.170 --> 08:02.060
So this has to match that I.D. of whichever input it corresponds to.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.520
And this doesn't really do a whole lot.

08:03.520 --> 08:09.570
The labels tag all it does this means if I click on the label itself.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.630
It activates the field.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.950
So instead of having to click on the field if I click on this label you'll see it puts my input into

08:16.950 --> 08:17.250
the feel.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.460
That's pretty much it.

08:18.480 --> 08:26.530
Aside from given a little visual as well to what the field is clicking on it also allows you to activate

08:26.530 --> 08:32.200
the field and then the very last thing you to do is create our submit burn now.

08:32.730 --> 08:40.030
So outside of those pyecraft tags just type person press tab and then this is going to be tight.

08:40.080 --> 08:48.500
He calls so Mitt because it submits our form and the name is going to be long again.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.490
BURTON like that.

08:50.580 --> 08:56.590
And then here you can just write walk in and then reverse that and you say.

08:57.420 --> 08:58.550
I log in.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.020
OK.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.350
I remember how I said this was a required field.

09:01.350 --> 09:05.080
So this is what I mean if I don't submit a value in here work let me submit the form.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.870
It's up something in there.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.440
This is also requires really put something in there too.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.500
If I type something in both of them and press that it submits.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.580
It's admits the form and that's it.

09:17.580 --> 09:18.690
That is our log in form.

09:18.690 --> 09:23.370
Obviously it's not styled yet and it doesn't do anything but that is all our logging form is going to

09:23.370 --> 09:24.330
consist of.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.390
Our register form is something very similar just with some extra fields.
