00:00.420 --> 00:01.600
Guys welcome back.

00:01.600 --> 00:04.800
So last time we had our logging form set up like that.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.140
Like I said it doesn't do anything and it's not style yet.

00:07.140 --> 00:12.520
But that is our form what we are doing now is just get the register form set up.

00:12.660 --> 00:17.520
Like I said last time it can be a very similar thing just one semester failed so what you can do is

00:17.520 --> 00:21.350
just copy and paste this whole form part.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.970
Copy that and we can paste it below on some space for so can see and click paste.

00:29.370 --> 00:36.810
I'm going to change that idea of the form from log in form to register form change their H to type text

00:36.810 --> 00:43.000
to create your free account.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.730
And then this the idea of the input form you can change to anything you want as long as it's different

00:47.730 --> 00:54.750
from this logging username so you can use register usernames you want to use username like that and

00:54.750 --> 00:57.610
changed the name as well to use the name.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.600
Text can say the same place whole again.

00:59.630 --> 01:01.570
So stay the same and keep required.

01:02.150 --> 01:06.730
Although this is because we changed this I.D. with to change this for here to use your name because

01:06.770 --> 01:08.750
number for has to correspond to the I.D..

01:08.940 --> 01:12.840
And like I said it doesn't matter what you call the idea as long as it's different from here because

01:12.840 --> 01:16.910
if ever same we tried to get the logon username text you would get.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.580
Which one would you take.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.780
So you have to be different.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.400
So we're going to create some space underneath the password one because the password fields are going

01:24.430 --> 01:26.310
be the last part of this form.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.530
Copy and paste this use in a field.

01:28.540 --> 01:32.840
Again it is a text field in all of our other fields are going to be text field.

01:33.090 --> 01:38.670
So we copy and paste that one more time this will be the first name.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.320
This can be last name.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.230
This can be email.

01:42.390 --> 01:45.520
This can be their email confirmation.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.630
So again they're going to type their email in twice and then will go have password down here.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.430
And then one more password which is your confirmed password.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.320
So copy in place the password one place in there.

01:55.380 --> 01:55.890
Okay.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.320
Now they have a of our fields.

01:57.530 --> 01:59.160
Although at the moment they're also username.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.570
So we're going to change those now.

02:00.600 --> 02:10.150
So I said the second one down was going to be a first name so change this to first name copy base at

02:10.260 --> 02:11.950
their days and to their as well.

02:11.950 --> 02:21.350
So for an I.D. matching the name this can be a first name like that and then e.g..

02:21.630 --> 02:24.700
But but but Samson.

02:29.060 --> 02:35.090
Last name and this is going to be the last name.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.990
One word copying base.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.900
On base that and this can be 7 percent.

02:42.050 --> 02:51.440
This is going to be email changes to email changes to email changes to email also change type of this

02:51.440 --> 02:57.030
one to email because email is a type of input and I'll show you what that does in a minute but e.g.

02:57.030 --> 03:05.900
you can do Bart email dot com and then go do confirm.

03:05.900 --> 03:15.470
Email is going to do email to copy and paste scienter there and there and then this also email just

03:15.470 --> 03:16.240
like above.

03:16.370 --> 03:20.700
And then this can just be the same thing but at the g mail dot com.

03:22.580 --> 03:30.000
Password must change we have to change it to password copy and paste in there so calling this password

03:31.590 --> 03:34.790
and then we can also do housework.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.650
But the password to.

03:38.280 --> 03:46.390
They're also just right that confirm the password like that and that's it.

03:46.410 --> 03:52.710
We're going to keep this burned down here with this business a log in it's going to say sign up and

03:52.710 --> 03:54.910
this is going to register button.

03:56.780 --> 04:02.810
So let's say that we're going to see both of the forms and on page say have you log in formally of your

04:02.810 --> 04:09.580
current account form and I let's put some Let's put a place holder in the password one two.

04:09.620 --> 04:16.880
So even the password fields will give a place holder equals your password.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.130
OK.

04:19.490 --> 04:27.560
Copy and paste it there and then will do to log in one as well that save it refresh the page.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.440
Oh see there.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.770
And you can change that to confirm your password if you want to but that's okay.

04:33.770 --> 04:37.360
So now we have a log in form and we also have our register form.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.990
And eventually we're going to only show one of these at the time.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.430
So if you want to log in we'll show long form.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.040
If I want to create an account will only show the register form.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.570
So you won't see both on the same page eventually.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.050
Okay.

04:50.060 --> 04:53.120
But for now good start we've made a log in form and our register form.
