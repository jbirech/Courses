Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.690 --> 00:06.090
So we're going to continue with our now playing bar here at the bottom and we're going to do now is

00:06.090 --> 00:09.110
make this play burn slightly bigger than the rest of the bones.

00:09.150 --> 00:14.670
If I show you my finish site you see that the blaber and down here is larger than the other burns that

00:14.670 --> 00:16.140
stands out a bit more.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.860
So we're going to do the same thing.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.030
So that's pretty simple.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.650
All you do is give a width and a height of thirty two pixels.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.950
So if I just show you in here way it look like width thirty two pixels.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.130
And then also height say two pixels.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.420
You see it looks slightly larger and stands out.

00:34.590 --> 00:38.910
And this is where that vertical and middle comes in.

00:38.910 --> 00:39.890
This one here you see here.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.000
Notice how they're all aligned in the middle vertically.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.930
If I delete that you see they'll go to the bottom.

00:45.930 --> 00:47.380
So that's what they're lines for.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.920
But anyway so all here do is add height and width.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.500
Is it because caputo's to go back to styled us.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.490
Yes yes.

00:56.880 --> 01:03.270
And underneath control both an image will go into a new one control button and then this is going to

01:03.270 --> 01:06.350
be play image.

01:06.510 --> 01:12.000
And what this study does is it is same as that although it looks for something with the class play as

01:12.030 --> 01:13.740
well as the class control burn.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.450
Because if you look back at our 8 year old structure you'll notice we gave them two classes.

01:18.510 --> 01:23.190
So now he's looking for controlled burn is also looking for the class play as well because this one

01:23.190 --> 01:29.010
he has two bones but we want this code to also apply to the pause button too because if I show you again

01:29.010 --> 01:33.740
and here you'll see that if I press play it change to a pause button so the pause button needs to be

01:33.750 --> 01:35.120
the same size as well.

01:35.400 --> 01:42.480
Okay and that's resemble all we ever do is copy and paste alive again for a comma and then change this

01:42.630 --> 01:46.430
to pause and that will now apply to the pause button.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.170
And inside there it was just width.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.580
Thirty two pixels.

01:50.580 --> 01:59.100
And then also height say theta pixels are I give a safe refresh page and hopefully you'll still see

01:59.100 --> 02:02.580
the playwear and with their slightly larger height than the rest of the burns.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.470
So one thing I do with these buttons is make it so that when your mouse hovers over them the mouse changes

02:07.470 --> 02:08.370
to a pointer.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.530
You probably remember doing this in earlier videos.

02:10.670 --> 02:11.720
And it's really simple.

02:11.820 --> 02:18.120
Oh we do say control burn coal on hover like that.

02:18.270 --> 02:27.180
And so their cursor pointer like that so that when you're first page you'll see that when you hover

02:27.180 --> 02:31.020
over the buttons now you get this pointer and that's it.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.170
Reassemble.
