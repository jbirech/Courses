00:00.230 --> 00:01.530
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:07.010
So in this video we're going to our sections so we can have three sessions this now playing bar the

00:07.020 --> 00:10.240
guard left section centre section and right section.

00:10.270 --> 00:15.780
And if I go back to here you can see this here is really the left section with the artwork in the name

00:15.780 --> 00:17.430
of this song and then the artist.

00:17.430 --> 00:23.370
This centre section is going to be the buttons for a play pause skip and then this bar on the right

00:23.430 --> 00:26.410
the right section is going to be where the volume brand goes.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.060
So go back to our next hour BHB file.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.060
Am I going to add three divs inside of this.

00:34.230 --> 00:37.240
Now Playing do measured space in there.

00:37.680 --> 00:49.230
So I make up Dave Dave press tab one of them's going to be Ida now playing left by that copy and paste

00:49.260 --> 00:50.170
that.

00:50.660 --> 00:57.080
So paste it below not side pasted below so much you don't paste it inside the now plane left of paste

00:57.090 --> 01:05.500
underneath and paste it again underneath that this was going to be now playing Shanter it's me now playing.

01:05.580 --> 01:06.290
Right.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.170
And then we will go back going stoney's individually there's not much style to apply.

01:10.470 --> 01:17.190
So inside now playing by should hopefully see your three divs here and the Now Playing left and playing

01:17.190 --> 01:17.580
right.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.780
Just one two lines of code.

01:19.920 --> 01:27.490
They just want a width of 30 percent and then a min width of 180 pixels.

01:27.510 --> 01:33.740
Don't know when you re size window that would get smaller than 180 pixels if they're larger than 180

01:33.780 --> 01:34.250
pixels.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.140
They'll keep shrinking until it gets there and 80 pixels and it won't shrink any further.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.960
Case you can see Freddy.

01:41.130 --> 01:44.700
Well it looks like so copy and paste that in.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.380
Go back to your style sheet.

01:46.380 --> 01:55.500
Society s s n n underneath there just but now playing the left side there.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.280
But we also want to do this for now plane right as well.

01:58.410 --> 02:06.420
So copy that and then paste underneath a comma and paste in an eighth in change left to right.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.240
So now this code will be applied to our plain left elements and an outline right elements.

02:11.260 --> 02:16.140
Okay that's because the commas there make sure you don't forget to put the comma there was a won't work.

02:16.150 --> 02:17.600
But the kind of there.

02:18.520 --> 02:24.630
If I go back to here to refresh the page you see the Now Playing left has vibes and width in another

02:24.740 --> 02:25.220
right.

02:25.260 --> 02:29.780
Also has no problem with now playing centre is actually in between those two.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.170
You just can't see it because it hasn't got a with yet.

02:32.220 --> 02:38.970
So yes go ahead and give that with now in there to a width 40 percent like that.

02:39.090 --> 02:45.990
And then you see those percent there are forks in the centre and 3 percent there say 30 30 40.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.210
Adding up to 100.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.640
So we are in total with 100 per cent width.

02:49.710 --> 02:58.810
We want the max width to be maybe 700 pixels we'll be able to change this when we actually add the content.

02:58.890 --> 03:03.550
So if we need to increase that we will find algebra 7 and it picks all of that would be fine.

03:03.570 --> 03:06.590
That means it won't get any larger than the 7 inch pixels.

03:06.630 --> 03:11.850
It will keep increasing in sizes as long as you resize the screen larger but it won't get any large

03:11.850 --> 03:13.410
in 700 pixels.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.520
So the section will have a maximum width of 7 inch of sorts.

03:16.590 --> 03:25.170
We also want to give this display flaks as well like that and then we want to say flex direction to

03:25.170 --> 03:27.830
be column.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.560
And this just says the direction of the flexible items and the column means they'll be displayed like

03:33.570 --> 03:34.390
columns.

03:34.630 --> 03:36.900
Okay you can do some more really up on that.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.520
I do suggest you know when and do some more research on that as some point is a very useful thing to

03:41.520 --> 03:42.090
know.

03:42.090 --> 03:46.690
Just Google fleck's Direction column and you'll get a very good list of articles come up.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.140
I go off and I'll just stick that in there.

03:49.150 --> 03:55.580
I'm guessing we do is just line up line items centre.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.480
Okay a line item centre.

03:57.480 --> 04:02.580
You won't see a change on at the moment but just know that this will make sure all the items inside

04:02.580 --> 04:04.620
there are aligned in the centre.

04:04.990 --> 04:09.630
So copy and paste that in to start a sheet at the bottom.

04:09.630 --> 04:19.770
Do now play King Centre like that paste in there and save it and then when it first the page you should

04:19.770 --> 04:27.820
see all your sections overshoot then so you should still see your 30 percent 40 percent and you 30 percent.

04:28.050 --> 04:28.930
I guess so.

04:28.950 --> 04:34.230
Style has been applied so that the main structure about now playing by know the last couple of videos

04:34.230 --> 04:39.820
have been pretty boring because always done is out pretty much empty elements that stick with this.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.640
It's always slow getting started like this because we have to get the basic structure of our 8 year

04:44.700 --> 04:50.670
old document down so I know the last few years have been quite slow we we've added one element per video

04:50.700 --> 04:56.540
but now we've done the boy pilot now can get drowsy adding the burns in the cool stuff.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.880
So these next viewers should be quite interesting.
