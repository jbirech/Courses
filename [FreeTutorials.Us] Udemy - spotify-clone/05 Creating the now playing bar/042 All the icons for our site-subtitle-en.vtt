Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:04.970
We're going to do now is start adding the burdens to our navigation bar.

00:05.070 --> 00:07.150
So there's a bunch of icons we need to use.

00:07.220 --> 00:12.320
And if you remember I do use icons 8 which is a very good application for our kind of thousands of my

00:12.320 --> 00:13.200
cousins in there.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.660
But of course if you have your own source maybe your website or you already own the icons obviously

00:18.660 --> 00:20.820
feel free to use those really go.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.310
You can search for burns maybe a playbook and then you can see all these different styles of things

00:26.310 --> 00:32.940
to do with play like you've got people playing you've got play burns here you've got these players down

00:32.940 --> 00:35.130
here which are the ones I've used.

00:35.130 --> 00:39.080
And also if you go to colour you see different styles for play.

00:39.540 --> 00:46.590
So different style play buttons Windows 10 style one Windows 8 styled ones.

00:47.080 --> 00:55.230
I like the IRS icons because they are pretty basic and we can also do is change the colour of your icons

00:55.380 --> 00:57.390
appear to whatever you want to use.

00:57.490 --> 01:02.700
And you see that the icons will change colour once it's just loading right now but the icons themselves

01:02.700 --> 01:03.770
will change colour too.

01:03.890 --> 01:14.040
If I change again it tax code to think that a lot of use for these is a 0 0 0 and it makes it that grey

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
colour.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.790
So all you do is open up your

01:20.430 --> 01:26.020
assets images icons folder and then you change the size to where you want.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.800
Twenty five is fine for a small icon.

01:27.810 --> 01:28.960
That's okay.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.840
That's more than enough.

01:30.990 --> 01:36.710
And then you just drag and drop the icon you want in to that.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.490
And then you can rename it where you want maybe your name that play or something like that.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.460
So that's what that's how you use it.

01:44.550 --> 01:49.490
But what I need to do is take the kinds of values from my site.

01:49.530 --> 01:55.890
So I've have a window open here and these are the icons I used for this site here.

01:56.090 --> 01:56.690
OK.

01:56.910 --> 02:00.430
So what I would do is copy and paste all of those.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.960
Copy those.

02:02.010 --> 02:08.170
Copy and paste into my icons folder and I will the same icons I used.

02:08.190 --> 02:14.130
These will be in the course content obviously so if you want to use these icons too you can either go

02:14.170 --> 02:20.400
find them yourself in here or you can just download the source file that's attached dyslexia and then

02:20.550 --> 02:23.240
just copy and paste it completely up to you.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.390
But this will just save you some time.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.320
Okay so we have our icons now.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.040
Great.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.290
Now let's actually start adding them to the page.
