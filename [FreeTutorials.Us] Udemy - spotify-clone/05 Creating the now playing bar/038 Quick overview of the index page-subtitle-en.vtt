Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:07.140
So now that we've finished with this register page it's finally time to get into our main pages of the

00:07.140 --> 00:11.780
site should you go across to here and show you what the results go look like.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.470
This is the kind of home page they're on.

00:14.620 --> 00:16.880
And you can see we've got a now playing by the bong.

00:16.890 --> 00:20.880
We've got navigation menu on the left and we've got the main content in the middle.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.880
And what we do is start with this now playing bar.

00:25.330 --> 00:30.040
But it's worth noting that eventually we will be splitting all this up into the files.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.850
So for example this now planning by the barn will be inside the filter file and this navigation by the

00:35.850 --> 00:37.130
left will be in the header.

00:37.230 --> 00:37.730
Okay.

00:37.770 --> 00:41.270
That's because those two things will appear every single page.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.380
Is this content amid all this great change from page to page.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.140
OK.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.490
So just to reiterate we will be splitting this up into a more organized structure soon.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.280
But what we're going to do first is just create all this on one page and then we'll split it up as and

00:56.280 --> 00:57.090
when we get to it.

00:57.100 --> 01:01.650
So just so that coding and together and not thinking way why is he doing this why isn't this splitting

01:01.650 --> 01:02.220
up.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.020
We will begin to that later on.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.500
We're just going to do it all on one page first and then we'll break it up.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.970
So like I said we'll start with this now playing bar because I think that's an interesting one to start

01:11.970 --> 01:12.490
with.

01:12.510 --> 01:17.150
It's kind of a fun one to get going and we'll come to this stuff later on.
