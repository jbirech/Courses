00:00.360 --> 00:01.590
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:05.240
We're going to work on today is this volume pie in the bottom right hand corner.

00:05.390 --> 00:08.840
And I'll show you what's go little like show shouldn't be a volume slider.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.210
Along with the volume burn right.

00:10.210 --> 00:17.220
And when you click on this burn it's going to mute the volume for you to head back to your page index

00:17.220 --> 00:18.130
of BHB.

00:18.210 --> 00:23.640
Scroll down to this section and we've have the bomb now playing right in there.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.410
Just put a div.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.620
And this is going to have the class.

00:30.140 --> 00:39.090
Volume bar like that says the class volume bar and inside of that if you're going to do a button and

00:39.110 --> 00:42.320
it's going to be the button the press to meet the song.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.490
So this is going to have the class.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.930
Control but and which is our class.

00:48.940 --> 00:51.980
We have here that we give to all our bones.

00:53.300 --> 01:00.270
And volume and title is going to be volume.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.040
But in my case when you hover over the boat and it's going to show volume burn and then in that burn

01:06.050 --> 01:12.710
which good image taric just like all the other Burns have done and the source is going to be ascites

01:13.070 --> 01:23.240
slash images slash icons and then slash images at the buttons cord so assets images icons it's going

01:23.240 --> 01:27.810
to be volume volume up in because we also have one volume mute.

01:27.830 --> 01:29.290
But this is just complete volume.

01:29.350 --> 01:38.180
PRNG So volume doppie and G like that save that and then refresh up aging you hopefully see a burn with

01:38.180 --> 01:39.370
that image.

01:39.410 --> 01:39.980
So there we go.

01:40.010 --> 01:46.680
There's a burn out there and we will give our image an old tag which remember is the value of this display

01:46.730 --> 01:48.670
if this image can't be found for whatever reason.

01:48.680 --> 01:54.840
Let's say this image is deleted or something or renamed rather than just sharing nothing else.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.480
It will show volume like that so people still know what the button does.

01:59.480 --> 02:00.820
Until we fix the problem.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.810
This doesn't make any difference to the functionality.

02:02.810 --> 02:06.890
It's just a really good habit to get into an alt attributes to a haemorrhages.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.870
So I would just leave it like that.

02:09.080 --> 02:18.200
Okay and now the Zephyr do is the slider part of this actual progress bar that so all we need to do

02:18.590 --> 02:21.260
is copy and paste the progress bar from above.

02:21.260 --> 02:25.050
Because remember we really informatic the progress bar for this part.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.910
We just need to copy and paste this code here so f thing from the class progress bar.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.560
Copy that from above and paste it underneath this burn here and then that's it.

02:35.750 --> 02:40.550
Let me just move this back a bit and then if I say that you hopefully see a progress by next to the

02:40.550 --> 02:43.930
burn area there's a progress bar.

02:43.940 --> 02:46.450
Obviously it doesn't look great at the moment but there it is.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.400
So let's go and stylist now.

02:48.430 --> 02:55.130
So right click inspect element on that and then we'll go to our volume bar to the div that's called

02:55.130 --> 02:56.350
roll bar.

02:56.600 --> 03:04.970
Let's give this a style we won't need to do much leches give it a width of the street 180 pixels so

03:04.970 --> 03:06.880
that's a good width.

03:06.890 --> 03:11.450
That's also a position absolute.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.540
And then right is going to be zero.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.830
Okay that's fine it still doesn't look great but this is okay.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.640
So copy and paste all that.

03:19.790 --> 03:23.330
Go back to our style sheet at the bottom.

03:23.330 --> 03:32.360
Just put forth like that place that in there and then save it and then progress bar.

03:32.390 --> 03:41.190
Right here we can give this a weight of 25 pixels.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.610
Yeah that's good.

03:42.770 --> 03:48.320
One under 25 pixel width and you'll see that we only have progress bar stiring applied here which has

03:48.320 --> 03:53.450
a with 100 per cent but we want this which to take effect when it is a volume bar.

03:53.480 --> 04:01.400
So copy and paste that and the way we do that is being a target the by a div that's underneath the volume

04:01.430 --> 04:09.730
bar case together to start a sheet and then do a volume bar progress bar like that.

04:10.010 --> 04:14.180
So the process by a device underneath the volume by div an hour an hour refresh.

04:14.180 --> 04:20.750
This should ideally see the style we did our right now obviously it's still not quite right is still

04:20.750 --> 04:22.370
too high up in this bar.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.480
So let's work on moving that down so go on the now playing.

04:25.510 --> 04:30.210
Right Dave right there and you see we only have two bits of style applied already.

04:30.620 --> 04:40.980
Let's just go ahead and give this a position relative and then make this have a margin top of 15 pixels.

04:41.180 --> 04:46.030
Yeah 16 is good and for some reason it's moving that as well.

04:46.040 --> 04:46.990
I'm not sure why that is.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.470
As a starter.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.260
I'm doing in the wrong part that I'm doing in there too.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.110
This style is being applied to both the Now Playing right and now playing left.

04:55.280 --> 05:01.200
So we only want to apply to the Now Playing right part to copy inflators two lines and go back to wrga

05:01.310 --> 05:03.680
and I can see that it's on line 28.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.600
So go back to line 28 and we have this code right here.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.140
Is now playing left and now playing right and we just want to do one for only now.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.400
Playing right like that gay peso's to in there.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.130
Save that.

05:19.220 --> 05:19.820
Okay.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.350
And there's our style.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.840
See the evidence supplied and it's pretty good right now.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.840
I'm happy with that.

05:24.890 --> 05:27.180
So ever but right here doesn't do anything yet.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.860
Loves it when we click it later and it would change on newburn and we will be able to drag these slides

05:31.880 --> 05:34.240
to which we can't do at the moment.

05:34.550 --> 05:35.600
Okay so that's it.
