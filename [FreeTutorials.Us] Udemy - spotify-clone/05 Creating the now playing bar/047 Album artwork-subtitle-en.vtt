00:00.540 --> 00:01.570
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.060
So I'm going to do now is make a start on this album artwork Square.

00:05.060 --> 00:06.630
It's going to be in the bottom left corner.

00:06.810 --> 00:09.390
So if I go back through this tab you see what's gone look like.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.170
So look something like this.

00:12.510 --> 00:13.640
This is fairly simple.

00:13.650 --> 00:19.400
Go back to our index of the HP page and we're going to be working in this now playing left div now game.

00:19.420 --> 00:23.520
So go to and now playing left live inside of that a new div.

00:23.670 --> 00:28.670
And it's going to have that class of content which we've already made the style for.

00:28.840 --> 00:36.990
So content you see here this clash here is if I show you right here you see content.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.360
Is this one.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.610
See the blue square like that.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.220
And you can see here we've given it a whipped 100 per cent against this content div. detects a wit of

00:47.230 --> 00:49.100
100 per.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.210
So.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.980
So add that to the Now Playing left.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.100
And inside of that we're just going to put our spam element by that.

00:59.130 --> 01:08.310
So Chris spann and the class for this is going to be album link like that album link.

01:08.420 --> 01:10.480
And last thing is you stick an image in here.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.220
So I only pressed tab.

01:12.230 --> 01:17.010
There's the image tag and the siac for source is going to be the link to the image.

01:17.030 --> 01:21.020
Obviously we don't have any images yet and we can't link it to some because you don't actually have

01:21.020 --> 01:22.720
any songs in our DirecTV yet.

01:22.880 --> 01:30.800
So all we do is just go and find as a filler image for now buy what we want to be a square as rock as

01:30.800 --> 01:33.290
album album.

01:33.380 --> 01:34.880
Our work here uses a square.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.080
So go back to here and take any of them.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.520
I'll take this one right here.

01:41.650 --> 01:47.750
He's going to his image so I copy and paste the URL for that image case to find any image because it's

01:47.780 --> 01:52.190
not really important because this is just a filler image so we can see what we're actually doing.

01:52.280 --> 01:57.760
And pasero own there and save that and you'll see hopefully an image.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.890
Obviously the stylings may be wrong the moment so that's fine.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.240
The fact that we're seeing something is good although it doesn't look very good right now.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.430
So in.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.460
So waistcoat has more style to this now to make this look better.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.650
So go down to where we have our image shot.

02:11.710 --> 02:19.850
I just inspect on that and then find this image piira Yes you go to the image we just added and then

02:19.850 --> 02:22.420
put height.

02:22.750 --> 02:30.380
One hundred percent like that's high 100 percent and already looks a lot better than a max width of

02:30.500 --> 02:36.670
fifty seven pixels so this means that memory size is page as you said 100 percent right.

02:36.680 --> 02:42.360
It will take a huge percent of however much this container is which will give you a max width of 57

02:42.370 --> 02:46.310
because all of me won't ever get wider than fifty seven pixels.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.690
We have this a margin on the right now.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.660
So margin right.

02:50.800 --> 02:57.020
And I still say 15 pixels go down and you see four hover over let's see the orange bar next to it is

02:57.020 --> 02:59.240
here the orange right that's the margin.

02:59.270 --> 03:04.760
So we've added a little margin because when we have our text we want a gap between the text in the image.

03:04.910 --> 03:10.400
So this this margin just creates of space between the text or where the text is going to go and the

03:10.400 --> 03:11.090
image.

03:11.090 --> 03:18.740
And then we just want to say float left because this will mean the text will flow alongside it.

03:19.010 --> 03:25.930
So copy and paste all that go back to see is our style sheet and then go to the barn and just Purt.

03:26.090 --> 03:27.210
Now Playing.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.890
Left and then what do we call the class of this image mujhe.

03:32.930 --> 03:36.250
Oh we don't actually give you a class yet so don't give this a class.

03:36.320 --> 03:43.080
So on the image tag just add the class album art work.

03:43.100 --> 03:43.500
Okay.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.750
So and the class alamar work worked the image.

03:47.020 --> 03:47.480
Right.

03:47.510 --> 03:52.630
And then in here just to drop the album art work like that.

03:52.760 --> 03:59.210
So we have now played left our Walmart work and then paste that carried that we just did in there right

03:59.270 --> 04:02.630
now when our refreshes page you should still see the sanco.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.120
Something else we can put in there.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.160
He's more like Carrie.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.150
Let's try.

04:09.710 --> 04:15.320
But ground size and then cover.

04:15.730 --> 04:18.030
And what does background size cover does.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.850
It's going to scale the image to be the largest size it can.

04:21.010 --> 04:25.320
As long as all of their space is covered so we have this square for our image.

04:25.420 --> 04:31.690
If we for example of loading an image for this artwork which is not square is a rectangle and it wouldn't

04:31.690 --> 04:35.610
fit in here rather than having just a rectangle shape.

04:35.630 --> 04:40.320
It would resize the image so it fills all of the available space.

04:40.420 --> 04:43.170
So that just makes sure that the whole space limage is covered.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.610
Okay so just stick around there.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.910
And then of course copying pace out back in the code right here.

04:48.160 --> 04:54.070
And I think it's one more thing I'm just saying it doesn't look quite the right height then go to the

04:54.070 --> 04:55.370
content div..

04:55.750 --> 04:58.630
And I think this actually needs a high it should be.

04:58.660 --> 05:05.970
I think it was 57 pixels we decided yeah this content did not age the height of the container.

05:06.010 --> 05:12.980
Okay so we're at this height fifty seven pixels to this now playing bar content bar a financial playing

05:12.980 --> 05:20.780
by a content so here and paste in there that's over and we're done.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.220
So there's there our bomar work.
