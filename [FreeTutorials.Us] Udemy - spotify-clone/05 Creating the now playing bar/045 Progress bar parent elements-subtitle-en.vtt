00:00.180 --> 00:01.420
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.420 --> 00:04.200
So now we're going to get side on our progress bar at the bottom.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.810
The one that looks like this.

00:05.990 --> 00:08.830
This progress by here and where we do it.

00:08.850 --> 00:11.750
This is naturally too complicated.

00:11.790 --> 00:18.240
Go better indexed our BHP and say this stuff here which belongs to this class.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.430
Byrnes one.

00:19.950 --> 00:24.650
So right here underneath that we're going to say div.

00:24.780 --> 00:35.280
And it's going to have a class of flavour far gazer class playback bar and this is going to be the div

00:35.280 --> 00:40.090
that houses our whole progress bar including the time parts right here.

00:41.100 --> 00:46.420
So the first thing you do is create a span which will hold that time that the time is currently on.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.890
So it creates an element and then give that class of.

00:52.980 --> 00:58.520
Progress tying like that in any other class for current.

00:58.580 --> 01:05.310
Okay so let's go two classes then do 0 0 0 because we're going to start the site of course and then

01:05.670 --> 01:09.100
copy that I'm going to paste it again below like that.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.350
And this is going to be time Progress time.

01:11.470 --> 01:16.380
And the second class is not going to be covering is going to be remaining this going be the time left

01:16.380 --> 01:22.830
in the song so save that and win it keep this 0 0 0 as well because it won't matter because as soon

01:22.830 --> 01:28.530
as the song plays this will obey on its own anyway so it doesn't matter that 0 0 for now and then in

01:28.530 --> 01:33.400
between those two credit of and skip this class.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.950
Of progress bar like that.

01:38.950 --> 01:39.610
Right.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.870
So how do you now save that.

01:42.100 --> 01:47.060
And you see that when you refresh the page you are having to look to great Sidonia.

01:47.770 --> 01:52.130
So style so right click I expect to learn on those.

01:53.730 --> 01:56.290
And then on span elements.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.970
So first of all let's change the colour so I can actually see it.

01:59.160 --> 02:06.780
Let's say colour and then let's do 8 0 8 0 8 0.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.580
Know that's the grey we use for these bones too.

02:09.900 --> 02:18.510
Okay so now you actually see the colour font size is going to be 11 pixels.

02:19.140 --> 02:23.360
And June 10th make it 11 pixels.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.710
It was again saying min width is going to be 40 pixels and you see that.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.540
Do anything yet.

02:29.550 --> 02:33.310
But we will when we add the actual process by itself.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.760
Text a line is going East Centre.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.710
Again you're actually anything with this yet but I know we need it.

02:38.730 --> 02:42.110
Susie read the progress bar and that's actually I think.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.150
Yeah that's it.

02:43.220 --> 02:50.380
Okay so just those for copy and paste that go back to our style yes s Scott Scott the barn and were

02:50.380 --> 02:55.530
going to add Progress time which is the class we gave it.

02:55.530 --> 03:02.650
Member save that school about how many should see both of them still have the same style that I now

03:02.680 --> 03:07.060
ask you some style did actual progress by itself and we haven't actually done anything with this.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.980
Can't see anything in the DIV yet but we can still style it.

03:10.170 --> 03:14.740
So firstly warning of this a width of 100 percent.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.190
Like that again you won't see anything yet.

03:17.350 --> 03:27.300
Who is next going of a height of 12 pixels and then with a say display in line flaks and the flexi hours

03:27.300 --> 03:29.170
are why I talked about in the previous lectures.

03:29.170 --> 03:32.790
And I said they're really worth looking into if you remember because they are quite useful if you know

03:32.790 --> 03:33.950
how to use them.

03:34.110 --> 03:37.650
And then finally with this cursor of pointer.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.020
So when we hover over it you'll see a change to a pointer.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.240
I really can't see anything.

03:41.460 --> 03:42.320
And the by itself.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.270
Yet you can see that the mouse is changing to a pointer.

03:45.550 --> 03:49.470
Everyone knows because there eventually the user going to add a drag along on this to move the song

03:49.470 --> 03:50.860
forward and backwards every one of them.

03:50.940 --> 03:56.460
They can click on this and you know at the moment obviously the bias in between those two were more

03:56.550 --> 04:00.980
when really we want it to be in the middle of them and the way we do that is by giving this play back

04:00.980 --> 04:02.030
bar here.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.240
Our display of flack's.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.230
Why that.

04:06.570 --> 04:07.100
OK.

04:07.380 --> 04:11.890
Those two things allowed me to add this display fleck's to this playback bar and then mostly to copy

04:11.890 --> 04:16.370
and paste the style and add this to the progress bar div.

04:16.390 --> 04:20.790
It's only styled at C S S with the progress bar first progress.

04:22.570 --> 04:25.420
Far that they say in there.

04:26.250 --> 04:31.960
And then we also want to do the display flex on the playback bar.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.710
So we can put that but vashi ONE KEY IS ONE OF comes first.

04:38.720 --> 04:47.700
So play back bar like that Pacer and then display fleck's an hour with save and refresh the page will

04:47.710 --> 04:50.690
hopefully still see the same styles.

04:50.770 --> 04:51.770
Great There it is.

04:51.970 --> 04:55.080
So we have our progress bar although it has nothing in there.
