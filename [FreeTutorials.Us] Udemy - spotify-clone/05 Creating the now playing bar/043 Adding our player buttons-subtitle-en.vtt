WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.450
You guys welcome back.

00:01.500 --> 00:05.270
So we have our icons we actually start adding these burns to our now.

00:05.280 --> 00:11.170
Bar So go back to our indexed our BHB and inside the Now Playing centre.

00:11.400 --> 00:16.050
Because remember this is our centre of the burns are going to go.

00:16.210 --> 00:17.650
Just dear.

00:17.810 --> 00:18.770
Press tab.

00:18.930 --> 00:25.690
And it's going to have the class of content make sure that's not I.D. It is classic.

00:25.950 --> 00:27.430
Not I.D. class.

00:27.630 --> 00:35.160
And we're going to be a second class code player controls so this defers to classes content and player

00:35.160 --> 00:40.980
controls and this content class and the style that comes with it is going to be applied in the deaves

00:40.980 --> 00:44.090
that we put inside these two sections later on.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.430
So this idea has two classes content and player controls.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.200
So there's contact lacerda have as one style.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.920
And I know those off top my head's discourteous style but yes yes we may as well add that while we're

00:55.920 --> 00:58.570
here and just do now.

00:58.680 --> 01:07.350
Playing far dark content so the idea of not playing bar and the content class within it and just pome

01:07.350 --> 01:13.050
with one hundred per cent that's all the sigga have and this the reason we are doing that is because

01:13.380 --> 01:20.800
we want this this bar down here to span across the whole width of the centre container.

01:21.270 --> 01:25.680
So just put that in there for now that you won't see much about that at the moment but just put it there

01:25.680 --> 01:31.970
for now save your job going forward and then back in index or BHB create some more space there and do

01:32.010 --> 01:32.620
div.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.420
And this is going to have the class Button's class he calls buttons like that.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.720
And then inside and this is actually where the birds are going to go.

01:42.840 --> 01:50.040
So we just put a button there to test it out for an hour just areti sees something just for helo or

01:50.040 --> 01:56.160
something and they're just saying see it actually happen to save that and go back to your page refresher

01:56.350 --> 02:01.890
and issue the helo burn there inside the centre div and where this style of the burns.

02:01.920 --> 02:09.560
Now so inspect element go to the burns div here and then really give this style of margin.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.700
It's going to be zero on the top.

02:11.850 --> 02:16.020
An auto on the left and right in you'll see what that means in a minute.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.860
Yes a display table.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.860
They go so the display table makes has behave like a table tag.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.650
If you haven't used table out before they're pretty useful.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.280
And this would be quite long.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.310
We do go into that now.

02:32.310 --> 02:39.210
So I recommend you look it up and now do seem to toro's on that or just send ask me a question the Q

02:39.210 --> 02:41.490
and essentially macnabb explain things a bit better.

02:41.490 --> 02:46.800
But for the purpose of keeping the video sure I won't go into details about the table tag now and going

02:46.800 --> 02:47.970
back to the margin part.

02:47.970 --> 02:52.270
You see that the auto gives it an automatic margin on the left and right.

02:52.290 --> 02:55.380
So we have zero on top automatic on the left and right.

02:55.560 --> 03:01.830
And there was mattick margin as it centres it pretty much set automatically sent it and applied a margin

03:02.190 --> 03:04.040
based on the width of the container.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.010
Okay.

03:05.010 --> 03:13.350
And that's it's a copy of pesos Lyons copier and going to put it in the SS file at the bottom three

03:13.380 --> 03:24.900
and new Select player controls space buttons like that and remember the player controls div is this

03:24.900 --> 03:26.190
one we created here.

03:26.340 --> 03:33.660
So Blair controls burns and is good to have that margin auto right there.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.310
Okay we're finally onto the buttons now.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.290
So we're not going use hello anymore for the burns.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.090
We actually add the images we want.

03:42.090 --> 03:44.070
So get rid of hello there.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.380
Get rid of an actual space below and inside the burn.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.590
We're going to do an image tax.

03:49.620 --> 03:55.950
I mge press tab and siac is the link to the image and you were the relative You are L to the file.

03:56.130 --> 04:08.330
So our image we use I should say icon is asit slash images slash icons slash sure full of PRNG is give

04:08.340 --> 04:15.110
me the shuffle button and that comes from RC Its images icons.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.130
Shuffle up in G.

04:17.160 --> 04:21.060
Peer shuffled up in G as I am using again.

04:23.020 --> 04:31.270
So if I refresh the page I'm sorry I look very good but I should hopefully see the outline.

04:31.390 --> 04:41.620
So give this burn a class of control button and this control burn class is going to be present on all

04:41.620 --> 04:47.140
of our burns but were going to give it a second class of shuffle and this shuffle class began to be

04:47.140 --> 04:50.520
used for the javascript later on right.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.020
So for now just put it away.

04:52.030 --> 04:58.210
Like I said before and some things you won't see much about that now but later on looking to use this

04:58.330 --> 05:01.010
when we use a javascript to handle the bow and presses.

05:01.010 --> 05:07.610
Okay so a title is going to be shuffle but turn like that.

05:07.630 --> 05:09.880
Again the title is when you hover over itself.

05:09.880 --> 05:16.610
I go back to here now and refresh the page you see because of that title to be used see when a hover

05:16.610 --> 05:21.580
over it appears and actually have spokes for wrong so go in at that f there.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.680
And then last thing on the image tab.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.960
Just do it out like that.

05:26.020 --> 05:32.200
All of course means alternate and just put a shuffle in there and what that means is if for some reason

05:32.200 --> 05:36.500
this image can't be found is going to add the should word shuffle.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.110
For example if I change that to S So this is wrong now.

05:40.150 --> 05:41.610
So the image won't be found.

05:41.650 --> 05:43.300
You'll see.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.580
Adds shovel.

05:44.650 --> 05:46.750
It just lets this burn still be useful.

05:46.810 --> 05:50.920
If the if the image can't be found so I'll change this back back to the correct image.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.470
Now save that and go back to was.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.970
Right now we're just style this burn to make it look a bit better so inspect Ellen on and on the burn.

06:00.690 --> 06:05.440
And then we can say background colour.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.250
It's going be transparent.

06:07.290 --> 06:08.800
Don't wear background colour there.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.690
We only want the icon there border is going to be known.

06:12.690 --> 06:13.520
Get rid of that.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.430
And then vertical a line middle.

06:17.430 --> 06:21.600
You only really see which about that number when we start adding all the best together you see wide

06:21.600 --> 06:23.180
vertical line middle as needed.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.650
So Copy that.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.620
Go back to see us as file and just do control like that.

06:34.210 --> 06:37.950
They're so controlled burn.

06:38.270 --> 06:44.470
And if you wanted to you could do a more descriptive one so you could just do like burns job.

06:44.500 --> 06:51.300
And but during matter that would be fine and just make sure that we observe our frezza age they go.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.340
So we still have it.

06:52.380 --> 06:55.660
And the last thing to do is just to make it smaller.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.250
So on the image measure it actually is not this burn here on the image.

07:00.420 --> 07:07.060
To wit 20 peaks and emken to say height 20 P X right.

07:07.290 --> 07:08.700
And that is it.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.460
So copy and paste those two.

07:10.710 --> 07:15.310
And then underneath control burn would disco do control.

07:15.510 --> 07:19.200
But again but this one has an image.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.480
They're going so controlled burn energy within high 20.

07:24.890 --> 07:27.220
Flatow page and make sure it's still there.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.680
And it is.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.530
So there's our shuffle burn.

07:30.610 --> 07:30.900
OK.

07:30.930 --> 07:31.530
Didn't do anything.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.480
Moment of course.

07:32.490 --> 07:37.050
But now when we had the others copy paste those lines.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.930
So we are one two three four five Burns there so I'll copy and paste.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.450
Make sure it appears five times so.

07:43.460 --> 07:48.650
One two three four five they're around.

07:48.700 --> 07:54.080
So we have previous burn the place burn the next and then the repeat burn.

07:54.210 --> 07:55.300
Okay.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.240
Now you just checked the names.

07:58.260 --> 08:02.500
We have previews next.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.010
Play.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.740
And then just repeat case change these names so we have.

08:10.830 --> 08:17.380
This was the previous play next.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.550
Repeat like that and then change these classes here also.

08:22.650 --> 08:28.500
So it can be previous play.

08:28.500 --> 08:37.600
Next a repeat like that and then change the changes to previous never it.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.280
The title is what when you hover over the edge what the text says.

08:41.450 --> 08:47.050
Play next and then repeat like that.

08:47.070 --> 08:50.890
Save that and then oh actually you need to do that to me.

08:50.920 --> 08:59.250
It will still work without it but imagine what I do here hear previous play next.

09:02.000 --> 09:02.580
Next.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.940
And repeat like that.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.100
Save that.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.800
Now we should see all five burns on there.

09:08.820 --> 09:10.620
And there we go.

09:10.620 --> 09:12.290
Perfect.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.070
But Reggie can add one more burden to that to show by the play burn.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.530
Copy and paste the play button.

09:18.590 --> 09:19.160
It's going to be.

09:19.180 --> 09:25.570
Pause So it changes to pause this again pause in this moment.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.370
He pauses.

09:26.370 --> 09:32.010
Well we have in an hour called porth or PFG and you see when I refresh their page now easy the pause

09:32.040 --> 09:39.000
button added there but then we're going to make sure that this at the moment this by default is set

09:39.000 --> 09:39.880
to display.

09:39.900 --> 09:40.310
None.

09:40.380 --> 09:45.000
So style equals display none.

09:45.050 --> 09:50.880
And style if you haven't seen this before is just a way of adding style to elements in line in what

09:50.910 --> 09:54.880
inline means is just there without using a C Ss file again.

09:55.410 --> 09:56.450
So style.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.420
And then you'll see that disappears.

09:58.460 --> 10:02.170
And the reason we did that is because we were in a shop start by hiding this.

10:02.250 --> 10:08.210
So when they refresh the page the sun won't be playing so hard the boys burn and when they press play.

10:08.220 --> 10:14.380
Eventually we'll hide the play button and show the pause button instead.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.290
So when pressed play it changes to a pause button when they pause it.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.980
Change to Labour Day.

10:20.370 --> 10:24.450
So your shows your Harv's the burned depending what they want you use asset.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.780
We have albums now.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.510
There are some slight changes to do.

10:28.510 --> 10:31.320
I can see some slight differences but we'll get to those soon.
