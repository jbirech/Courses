WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.430
A big iceberg and back.

00:01.560 --> 00:03.220
So continue on with our progress bar.

00:03.240 --> 00:06.450
We only have two more days to add and then we're done with the structure.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.170
So is the progress by Dave here.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.930
Let's create some space between the elements so it'd be easy to see.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.500
So inside the forest by Dave here just add another day of.

00:16.610 --> 00:25.530
And this is going to have that class progress bar b.g. for background progress bar background.

00:25.700 --> 00:32.450
And what this is going to be is a kind of darker grey colour you see here.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.350
Okay.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.620
And then in the second element going to add it's going to be the ownness the lighter colour that sits

00:37.620 --> 00:38.720
on top here.

00:39.060 --> 00:48.480
So inside that Dave just crave one more day of its going out the class to just progress.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.430
This is actual progress of the progress bar.

00:51.430 --> 00:52.740
And we're not going to put anything in here.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.510
So if you want you can just keep on the same line so we can keep those two on the same on this one because

00:57.510 --> 00:59.840
nothing's going to go inside this differe here.

00:59.880 --> 01:05.730
So we have added two divs there the progress bar background our progress div gains are safer.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.400
And I'll show you.

01:09.890 --> 01:11.650
We're going to do with them.

01:11.750 --> 01:18.230
So it's on air we about to Dave's pro barber down in progress and the progress bar hugger said is he

01:18.220 --> 01:20.300
can have that dark grey colour.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.040
So let's go ahead and give it that so background colour.

01:24.410 --> 01:29.070
And I the cologne he uses for 0 4 0 4 0.

01:29.610 --> 01:33.370
Okay you're a C anything yet because we haven't given you a whit through high yet.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.950
Does he give us a height of 4 pixels.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.990
Obviously you can play around that as you like.

01:39.320 --> 01:47.440
But then we're going to get width of 100 percent and now you see the progress bar background itself.

01:48.020 --> 01:57.070
So let's get rid of these square corners let's just give the border radius of let's say two pixels because

01:57.110 --> 01:59.260
it's a fairly small line.

01:59.270 --> 02:04.940
So with only the whole lot of radius and you see it now is curved on the edges and that's it.

02:05.030 --> 02:07.190
Sorry it demaree about the fact this not in the centre.

02:07.190 --> 02:07.380
Yeah.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.380
That's fine.

02:08.650 --> 02:16.310
But copy and paste those and then go back to your style as yes s and Member this one's for progress

02:16.310 --> 02:22.480
bar background so progress bar b g like that.

02:22.580 --> 02:28.940
I like that paste and they're saving up hurtfully you still see it and there it is.

02:28.940 --> 02:34.500
So a last thing to do are these two new deaves we added is just to start the progress one.

02:36.110 --> 02:40.920
And in this room we're going to do background colour.

02:40.970 --> 02:49.880
Is it going to be a 0 8 0 8 0 which is this cover again this grey that we've used.

02:50.180 --> 02:52.520
And you won't see anything with this yet again.

02:52.520 --> 02:58.330
Let's also give this a height of four pixels like that.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.190
And then when I say width zero.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.900
David onagawa ANY with the epk is the with these and be decided depending how long is left of the song.

03:07.010 --> 03:08.880
Okay so with zero.

03:11.060 --> 03:16.350
And then finally a broader radius is going to be two big cells again.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.680
Kaser just matches the the background of game.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.020
And that's it.

03:21.020 --> 03:21.680
That's it for that.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.390
And I'm showing in a minute wasco and what is going to do when we change the width.

03:25.410 --> 03:32.780
So you just got the in place those for now go back to your style at C S S in add a progress style like

03:32.780 --> 03:38.990
this progress save that refresh the page as measure is still there.

03:39.230 --> 03:41.380
And you see we still have our style.

03:41.750 --> 03:49.340
So with this fudges change the high right here so you can see let's say a 10 percent like that you see

03:49.340 --> 03:55.370
that one we increase the width the progress bond goes along and that's what we won.

03:55.370 --> 04:02.060
So every time the song moves forward we're going to be updating this width depending on how left.

04:02.060 --> 04:03.970
So for now just keep it as zero.

04:03.980 --> 04:07.080
And we will come back to that when we actually have songs to play.

04:07.280 --> 04:07.760
But that's it.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.930
We're done with that.

04:09.470 --> 04:16.010
But it's you can't get this in the centre or you need to do is add some style to this progress bar piira.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.320
Here is one line.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.830
Just gonna give you a little bit of margin.

04:18.860 --> 04:27.670
So margin top at Cisco three pixels in another seeking increases as you like so you can make it five

04:27.680 --> 04:33.320
pictures if you really want our fingers off top of my head I think I've used three pixels on my actual

04:33.330 --> 04:36.010
site which you see isn't quite centred here.

04:36.170 --> 04:41.310
But I'll tell you why we won a used three is because we're going change the font of these.

04:41.630 --> 04:45.970
And when we changed the fun is going to be a slightly larger or smaller font.

04:46.010 --> 04:51.160
So we'll keep it three for now we can come back to that if we want to change that later.

04:51.350 --> 04:57.260
So remember this classical progress bar so they want to hear but we're not just going to add it to the

04:57.260 --> 04:59.050
progress bar dev right here.

04:59.060 --> 05:05.840
The reason being we're going to use a similar div when we come to create the volume slider which is

05:05.840 --> 05:10.250
looks very very similar to this progress slider Okay.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.670
So really we're a bit more specific with our Selecter.

05:12.680 --> 05:21.630
We're going to say play back bar space progress bar.

05:22.310 --> 05:24.320
So mardin top three pixels.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.600
And the reason we're going to add this part well is so that it only adds the three bits of margin to

05:29.600 --> 05:35.780
the ones that are within the playback by the playback bar this whole thing right here because the volume

05:35.780 --> 05:38.210
cida won't have this play by a while.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.550
So it won't add the three pixel margin.

05:40.790 --> 05:41.270
Okay.

05:41.330 --> 05:43.740
And we don't know whether we can add that to the volume or not.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.830
We can address that when we actually come to implement the volume slider.

05:46.970 --> 05:47.510
Okay.

05:47.510 --> 05:53.520
So now just put that in there and we can address the volume slider one as we get to it.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.630
So save that versus page.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.010
And that should be it.
