00:00.820 --> 00:01.900
You guys welcome back.

00:02.060 --> 00:06.380
So it's finally time to get started with our actual music player aspect of the site.

00:06.390 --> 00:08.370
So this is our index page of the moment.

00:08.370 --> 00:11.710
Remember we put this here just to test it it worked.

00:11.830 --> 00:17.250
I'm going to start off with the Now Playing bar at the bottom which looks like this.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.530
This sort of thing.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.720
So go ahead and open index up.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.890
HP It's already open.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.330
So we're doing with these register phones now.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.210
The indexed file.

00:27.540 --> 00:30.800
And you see this is where we have so get rid of that help.

00:30.810 --> 00:31.990
We don't need that anymore.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.840
Next one more space and let's jump right into it.

00:35.850 --> 00:37.070
Let's start with Dave.

00:37.090 --> 00:47.030
This is going to be the container for our now playing bar so we can give it an idea of now playing bar

00:47.840 --> 00:48.720
container.

00:48.760 --> 00:53.280
I know it's a long name but it's a good one because it's descriptive and descriptive names are better

00:53.280 --> 00:58.200
than short names because if you have to come back to l.a. you can easily see what this elements purposes

00:58.230 --> 01:01.110
just by reading the idea of you going.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.400
So now playing a container and what we might do with this is just style as we go.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.230
So if just added this div onto there.

01:07.260 --> 01:12.690
Okay save that and refresh the page you won't see any difference except from the helo disappears.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.890
But inspect 11 on this now.

01:16.790 --> 01:23.780
And open the body up in the body up again you see our container that we had it and then go to our style

01:23.840 --> 01:25.560
right here.

01:26.490 --> 01:34.920
Let's just give this in St. Louis as you see something happening as a 100 percent okay so spans across

01:34.920 --> 01:43.810
the whole page as a background colour is going to be 2 8 2 8 to 8.

01:44.100 --> 01:48.000
And I have that colouring down here so I know that's the rally we want but it's just like a slightly

01:48.000 --> 01:50.710
lighter than completely black.

01:50.950 --> 01:51.190
OK.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.880
And the reason we're not seeing anything at the moment is because this doesn't have a height set.

01:54.900 --> 01:59.580
So if we just say height just to see what happens hundred pixels.

01:59.610 --> 02:00.080
OK.

02:00.330 --> 02:03.820
We're going to get rid of this higher actually though so we just cover it high there so.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.440
Actually see what's happening.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.350
So high 100 pixels temporarily.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.400
And then we at this at the bottom of the page.

02:10.440 --> 02:17.520
So when I say bottom zero like that you won't see at the bottom yet because we have to change the position

02:17.580 --> 02:20.530
so positions can be fixed like that.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.440
Okay so now this appears at the bottom.

02:23.580 --> 02:24.690
It will always at the bottom.

02:24.690 --> 02:30.540
See in the middle where the bottom is you stay at the bottom and then there's also starts have min width

02:30.620 --> 02:36.970
so a minimum width of 620 pixels or something like that around that's fine.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.650
All that means is when you recycled the window this content will only get a scenario has six engine

02:41.660 --> 02:42.860
20 pixels.

02:43.140 --> 02:48.970
And as for this gap round here we actually fix this this same sort of thing in the register page which

02:48.970 --> 02:53.460
is estimate to the h.t. email amman's and the body elements have no margin and no padding.

02:53.460 --> 02:57.220
So we'll fix that soon so for now just ignore that we'll get to that.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.390
So this does fine.

02:59.850 --> 03:03.110
Copy and paste that goes back to here.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.630
But we don't actually have a style page yet.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.010
Okay so we have to create one.

03:07.110 --> 03:11.740
So create a new file command and file new file however you want to do it.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.890
And this is going to be our style the csx file.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.470
So say this in assets it's.

03:19.530 --> 03:28.910
And then just call it style DOS assess save there and then this is now playing bar container.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.140
So eidy now.

03:32.220 --> 03:36.830
Now playing bar container.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.810
Put that in there.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.980
And it is per comment.

03:40.980 --> 03:44.100
Next the height so we do remember to remove that so

03:47.070 --> 03:48.960
remove later.

03:49.090 --> 03:51.580
Okay just so we need to get rid of that.

03:51.590 --> 03:52.040
Hi.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.280
I'll explain that.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.310
And I explained why we're going to move that later a bit later.

03:57.660 --> 03:58.720
So save that for an hour.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.710
And before we check it we have to actually link to this file.

04:03.180 --> 04:10.870
So in the index appear to be in the head section here and in each title say link press tab.

04:11.160 --> 04:20.780
And that puts a stylesheet actually in an eight hft just going to be as it's slash csx slash style.

04:20.910 --> 04:26.060
Yes yes save that and then refresh this page will hopefully still see our style.

04:27.090 --> 04:27.700
There we go.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.140
And you see a haslinda our style sheet right here.

04:30.170 --> 04:35.430
And as far as that gap goes like a sable address that later at that time is now.

04:35.430 --> 04:43.230
So let's go to our style sheet and do a cmo comma body which means it's been applied to both A's male

04:43.380 --> 04:50.490
amants and the body elements because you see there's an atrium area here and the body element here and

04:50.490 --> 04:58.000
then just put padding zero and then margin zero just like that.

04:58.140 --> 05:02.830
And also height 100 percent like that.

05:03.060 --> 05:03.820
OK.

05:04.290 --> 05:13.010
Now first the pay gap will have gone and it has great debt that's now playing by content.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.590
Next thing to do is stop some component here.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.660
It's buttons in our sliders.
