Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:06.690
So we're going to continue with our now playing bar so go back to our index page and add another element

00:06.690 --> 00:09.520
inside the Now Playing barkentine.

00:09.570 --> 00:12.830
So in here do div first tab.

00:12.900 --> 00:19.180
And this is going to have I.D. of now playing bar.

00:19.560 --> 00:25.280
So is that actual now playing bar and say that again we can go and style this inside here.

00:25.590 --> 00:33.560
So refresh the page and then when you expand the play market taney SHOULD SEE NOW plant bar inside there.

00:33.670 --> 00:41.890
So let's go ahead and style this and we're going to say display flex and what flex is.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.960
It literally is just a flexible display actually.

00:46.140 --> 00:51.670
And if you just Google Display flex.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.970
There's a very good guide to flex box right here.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.410
Doug Rizzo a complete guide to flex blocks.

01:02.090 --> 01:07.760
Complete with diagrams to make it easier for you to understand but if you expand background you get

01:07.760 --> 01:10.310
this explanation right here.

01:10.310 --> 01:15.180
And Lucky says the Flex box layout is really just to make it as flexible as possible.

01:15.260 --> 01:21.140
In a sense it's going to alter its width and height in order to fill all available space so make it

01:21.140 --> 01:22.520
bigger make it smaller.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.370
It really is just a flexible display attribute.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.760
So you got to have a really valuable time.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.660
So for an hour just display flex and we're also going to set a higher should be.

01:32.780 --> 01:39.380
But before we do that we don't remove that high part from here like we discussed so I'll remove it from

01:39.380 --> 01:39.800
that.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.640
Now playing bar container and it will disappear.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.620
Okay that's fine.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.140
Go back to our playing bar and inside there.

01:48.160 --> 01:52.080
Do height 90 six and they go.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.670
So now we actually have that container with a high again.

01:54.840 --> 02:02.470
We are going to have some padding no padding can be 16 pixels and then this is pretty big right now

02:02.480 --> 02:09.710
so are going to say box sizing and then board the box and what that does it means that the height is

02:09.710 --> 02:12.340
going to take into account 16 pixel padding.

02:12.440 --> 02:18.750
So it's going to be 90 pixels and over 90 pixels it's including the 16 pixels papping.

02:18.830 --> 02:26.370
So if we disable that it's adiga 90 books with a height with a 16 pixel padding on all sides which means

02:26.370 --> 02:29.220
that the actual height comes to 122.

02:29.570 --> 02:38.630
So by an by adding box sizing border box it means Make it 90 pixels including these 16 bits with padding.

02:39.130 --> 02:40.060
That's it.

02:40.150 --> 02:42.620
Copy those lines go back to us.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.670
Yes as file.

02:43.810 --> 02:50.580
So this is going to be now for aying bar and peso's in there.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.260
And it refers to days.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.860
We should hopefully still see that.

02:56.090 --> 03:01.100
I notice I've called it now playing bars and outlaying bar.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.810
It should be within the page.

03:06.430 --> 03:07.610
And it's still not right.

03:07.630 --> 03:15.400
Oh I remember I didn't actually remove this high this high 100 pixels I removed in the browser but not

03:15.400 --> 03:15.640
there.

03:15.640 --> 03:19.770
So make sure you emptied the this high one and your pics okay.

03:19.900 --> 03:26.860
Delete this so you can go save that and the first page.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.270
And there we go.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.430
It doesn't look like we've done much.

03:30.430 --> 03:34.360
The reason we've done that is because this PA is going to be the whole bar.

03:34.370 --> 03:39.280
If you look at what is doing it up this now playing barkentine it is the whole luggage says container

03:39.310 --> 03:43.080
for an plane bar an outlet bar underneath it.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.770
The blue section.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.810
See the blue rectangle above and that's where the components are going to go inside that little blue

03:49.810 --> 03:50.260
square.

03:50.260 --> 03:52.260
This year blue rectangle.
