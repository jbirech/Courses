00:00.450 --> 00:01.500
Guys welcome back.

00:01.500 --> 00:05.820
So now I'm going to work on putting some text next to this album artwork part now.

00:06.030 --> 00:07.760
So the way we do that is pretty simple.

00:07.770 --> 00:11.330
Go back to our indexable BHP page inside of this.

00:11.520 --> 00:18.960
Now Playing left div guys out of the content parr's well and just underneath our link there just underneath

00:18.960 --> 00:21.360
that span element is where were going to put the text.

00:21.510 --> 00:28.650
So underneath there we can just say div revenues but class equals track info.

00:28.720 --> 00:35.070
Dictionaries contain information about the track that's playing pin in their Wisco say span and this

00:35.070 --> 00:37.470
is going to be glass.

00:37.500 --> 00:42.310
He calls track name by that.

00:42.420 --> 00:42.740
Right.

00:42.740 --> 00:45.470
And in one more span in there just an empty span for an answer.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.480
But that got the in place that.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.570
Below like that so we have those two in a row.

00:51.720 --> 00:59.910
But change this track name class to artist's name right inside these spans being just put some text

00:59.910 --> 01:00.630
for to it.

01:00.650 --> 01:03.560
Is this the name of the song so is Kobe.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.050
Happy birthday.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.980
And then my name is the artist.

01:09.180 --> 01:10.040
Okay.

01:10.050 --> 01:14.760
Just so you can see what we have on the screen and you can actually see it right there.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.560
It's just the wrong colour.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.320
So Alex actually style this.

01:18.590 --> 01:27.600
So Claire come inspect alone on those and then find they're the new elements we added you right here.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.920
So the versing very well indeed make it so that we can see this text.

01:31.020 --> 01:36.510
But what I realized what we also didn't do a point is say a default font style so you can see that this

01:36.510 --> 01:38.280
font isn't very good right now.

01:38.490 --> 01:45.290
So we know better or C S S file and are going to create a default style for our text croston whole Web

01:45.290 --> 01:46.070
site.

01:46.890 --> 01:51.540
So put the star which means all so this style and apply to all attributes.

01:51.540 --> 01:58.880
Now everything and we won't put a font family in there and fund families how you specify which fund

01:58.880 --> 01:59.860
to use.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.770
And we do a quick Google search for font family.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.620
So fund family Cisco ebtekar like that font family of Attica State the top link.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.370
And you can just take this part right here.

02:15.390 --> 02:20.130
So the reason I've just searched for this is because it will provide some very good backup fonts that

02:20.130 --> 02:20.640
are used.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.050
If this run can be found.

02:22.050 --> 02:25.950
So if a browser didn't support this fonthill Try that font and if it can't do that when you try that

02:25.950 --> 02:26.520
fine.

02:26.730 --> 02:34.880
So just copy and paste that into our code so copy that and paste it into are all style right there.

02:35.250 --> 02:40.410
So that means you save that I'll show you if that means that when we refresh this page you'll see that

02:40.410 --> 02:43.510
this font styles change like that.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.040
And he even has fun here for these numbers.

02:46.150 --> 02:48.220
So already that was lower better.

02:52.170 --> 02:58.500
So because the specifier default colour Frank text on our website by saying colour their first half

02:58.500 --> 03:03.210
which is white right now if you're fresh debate should see Texaco white.

03:03.420 --> 03:08.820
So right now we've specified that if we don't say otherwise all text on our website is going to use

03:08.820 --> 03:09.540
this.

03:09.540 --> 03:13.040
So now we've done indeed far we can scroll down and override this if you want to.

03:13.150 --> 03:18.520
So inspect aliment on the track name before we do that we're not going to track info Dave.

03:18.540 --> 03:25.430
So go to the track info part and when give this a style of display table.

03:25.710 --> 03:32.240
And this just means that this trackin faux pas will behave like it's a table element.

03:32.450 --> 03:34.840
So is one of these table estimate elements.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.150
And if you haven't used those before I do suggest looking into those as well.

03:39.150 --> 03:43.440
And since this is an aid intro to Asia e-mail course I'm not going to go into a whole lot of detail

03:43.440 --> 03:48.640
about those about each acor element in this course because it slows things down for people who have

03:48.750 --> 03:49.130
seen it.

03:49.130 --> 03:53.730
So if you do need to see those you ask me a question or you can just search online because there's tons

03:53.730 --> 04:00.030
of good resources to learn about different astm elopements so display table is fine for that so tracking

04:00.190 --> 04:07.610
up display it will do it here and for track info display table.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.770
And let's go to the track name span right here.

04:11.070 --> 04:12.290
And this style this.

04:12.570 --> 04:21.860
So we have starboard you know margin of six pixels on top and bottom and zero on left and right.

04:22.260 --> 04:26.860
So there are a margin on top and bottom of six pixels but nothing on the left and right.

04:27.720 --> 04:36.340
So display in line BLOCK So this means you'll behave like an inline element but also a block element.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.830
So example of an in limit.

04:37.860 --> 04:42.890
So an example of an inline ellerman is a span an example of a block element is a P tag.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.150
The paragraph tag.

04:44.490 --> 04:51.270
So underneath that just pure width 100 percent like that and you'll see that now we have a text on different

04:51.270 --> 04:52.140
lines.

04:52.650 --> 04:53.610
So that's good now.

04:53.710 --> 04:58.060
Copy and paste that go and then go and put it into your C as s.a.g.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.860
So now playing left.

05:03.110 --> 05:11.750
Track in info track name by that than pay sign there say we could really specify this now playing left

05:12.050 --> 05:13.180
above this.

05:13.180 --> 05:18.080
It's always better if you specify the selectors in as much detail as you can because it means you are

05:18.080 --> 05:20.760
less likely to accidentally override something in future.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.420
So this would work.

05:22.430 --> 05:23.750
But this also works.

05:23.750 --> 05:29.570
It just is just better if you add more detail to it so it doesn't really matter too much but it is a

05:29.570 --> 05:30.860
good habit to get into.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.570
So this right here would work just as well.

05:33.620 --> 05:37.900
But we're going to specify in detail save that.

05:37.950 --> 05:42.320
The last thing to do is just give this gift from style to the artist name.

05:42.320 --> 05:48.470
So go down to the artist named Dave spann Sari's an idea it's a span and I believe this is only going

05:48.470 --> 05:56.060
to have two things which to specify as a font size to make it slightly smaller 10 pixels 11 12 lascaux

05:56.090 --> 06:00.050
12 pixels and then colour.

06:00.170 --> 06:08.170
Just be this grey that was used a 0 8 0 8 0 which because Ed is this great colour right here.

06:08.690 --> 06:13.730
And I just realize we need to actually apply this to the span below so cobbin base out you can't see

06:13.730 --> 06:14.500
anything yet.

06:14.540 --> 06:20.330
It used to go to EspaÃ±ol element underneath so paste in there and you see it change colour.

06:20.480 --> 06:20.980
Okay.

06:21.050 --> 06:22.760
So that's it.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.870
Take those two styles that we just did.

06:24.980 --> 06:31.230
Go back to here and then we going to say now playing left.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.430
Track info artsiest name and inspan.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.500
By that baseline there and that's it.

06:40.950 --> 06:45.810
And like I said you don't actually have to go into this much detail you could even leave track in four

06:45.810 --> 06:46.830
hours or something.

06:46.910 --> 06:51.460
But the more detail you're into the less likely you are to accidentally overwrite something.

06:51.470 --> 06:56.040
So refresh the air and you hopefully see exactly the same style applied.

06:56.360 --> 06:56.940
Okay.
