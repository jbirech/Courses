00:00.210 --> 00:01.450
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.680 --> 00:03.030
It's what I did last time is gauer.

00:03.040 --> 00:07.170
Logan handler working which now means out log in for an average of one.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.970
Both work as expected.

00:08.970 --> 00:12.290
The issue at the moment though is that you don't stay logged in.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.340
What I mean by that is there's nothing keeping track of when you're locked in or not.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.860
So I'd go to the index page right now indexed obvious B and it works.

00:19.950 --> 00:25.320
We don't want to allow them to get to this page unless they're locked down right which means we have

00:25.320 --> 00:29.090
to maintain their log in so we have to remember whether they're logged in or not.

00:29.190 --> 00:34.680
And as a really really simple but our schomer do now we need something called sessions and Sessions

00:34.680 --> 00:38.060
lead to save variable values across pages.

00:38.240 --> 00:38.570
OK.

00:38.620 --> 00:42.420
So most variables lose value as soon as you graph that page.

00:42.690 --> 00:45.340
But with session variables they maintain their value.

00:45.510 --> 00:50.580
So the first thing you need to do and there's not many things to do is none of them a very short list

00:50.580 --> 00:58.390
of things to do as is right in the conflict up HP file session and as scores start.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.290
And this enables the use of sessions.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.780
Okay so without this our sessions won't work.

01:03.780 --> 01:10.610
So remember this bit of code here session and the score start at end with we nearly don't now always

01:10.640 --> 01:16.160
have to do is go to your logging handler and then in this part where if is always true.

01:16.170 --> 01:23.100
So if there logon was successful we're just going to write does science underscore session like that

01:24.450 --> 01:29.460
and this is going to be user logged in.

01:29.730 --> 01:32.620
So we're creating the session variable user logged in.

01:32.870 --> 01:39.980
I'm going to give you the value of the user name which is this one up here the value then in the form.

01:40.050 --> 01:44.490
So usually then will be set to the user's username and that's it.

01:44.490 --> 01:50.180
Copy and paste that line that has me do the same for the register handler song and go to register handler

01:50.180 --> 01:51.070
that BHP.

01:51.330 --> 01:59.040
And in this by air if laurean was successful pasted a half do before it redirect the user session you've

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
logged in equals username which is available here.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.530
So use London username so that's it we've great session.

02:05.530 --> 02:06.640
Robles It works.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.900
All that's left to do now is redirect them from the index page.

02:09.900 --> 02:16.440
If they're not logged in already so go to the index page open there which is in the root of your website

02:16.440 --> 02:17.490
folder.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.000
So index iph.

02:19.050 --> 02:23.510
Open that up and above all the AC simple code A and BHP tags.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.680
And this is where we check to see if the session variable is set.

02:26.910 --> 02:39.060
So we're going to say if it is set aside and the score session and user log

02:41.790 --> 02:49.190
in like that is use locked down and this needs to match exactly with how you have it here.

02:49.330 --> 02:53.010
Okay this has to match exactly.

02:53.010 --> 02:54.140
Next up it should be.

02:54.240 --> 03:02.400
So if it is set to do is create the be variable use logged in and set it equal to the session variable

03:02.400 --> 03:04.620
here there.

03:04.630 --> 03:09.570
So now the green variable called use of the end which contains the user's username because that's what

03:09.570 --> 03:10.380
we set this to.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.750
We set the session variable to the user name and asit else.

03:15.780 --> 03:25.590
So if the session is not set we want to redirect them back to the register page header location cattle

03:26.070 --> 03:29.500
location registered dot HP.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.680
Just like that and that is that simple.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.520
We going have a problem with this at the moment because we don't have the session start Pyaar we have

03:35.580 --> 03:35.910
here.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.980
It's in the conflict file or address every need.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.100
This recession is to work on the index page.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.780
There is no session start.

03:42.780 --> 03:48.270
So what are we to do rather than just add sessions start linear add referenced this config file.

03:48.690 --> 03:51.070
So right at the top there.

03:51.330 --> 03:56.640
Include includes slash conflict.

03:56.710 --> 03:57.370
HP.

03:57.510 --> 03:58.090
And that's it.

03:58.100 --> 04:03.480
Now our sessions start code will be included on the index page and we can use sessions and it's really

04:03.480 --> 04:04.010
that simple.

04:04.020 --> 04:04.700
That's it.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.850
We've done all we need to do our show.

04:06.850 --> 04:11.630
I mean if I so if I were trying today indexed up HP page now you'll see it won't let me go there.

04:11.630 --> 04:16.390
It will redirect me back so I'm back on the net and the range should appear to be page.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.380
If I log in though.

04:18.740 --> 04:23.120
Password thing I type that write up that ever.

04:23.130 --> 04:30.320
Nope typed it wrong so password there.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.850
Now we can get there.

04:33.380 --> 04:38.300
So now I can be on the index page because I'm locked down and you should also test out the register

04:38.300 --> 04:38.850
form.

04:38.950 --> 04:44.120
So you should test it here as well to measure when you read it successfully redirects you to the next

04:44.120 --> 04:47.940
page if you want to read if you want to manually log out though.

04:48.420 --> 04:52.140
We need to do is include this code on the page.

04:52.370 --> 04:55.950
So just write session destroyed.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.770
So we have an absolute includer a log out.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.480
Byrne Yeah.

04:59.510 --> 05:06.740
So until we implement log aaba And if you ever want to log out manually just include this code and then

05:07.580 --> 05:09.820
nothing unless it's very page.

05:10.520 --> 05:15.410
Okay so my session has been destroyed and I'll read it refresh and then it takes me back.

05:15.620 --> 05:20.900
Okay so session a story is just a log now so common that out measure you're only uncommented if you

05:20.900 --> 05:25.420
need to use it because if you forget to comment it out again it will laqueur every time.

05:25.430 --> 05:26.660
You might not know why.

05:26.830 --> 05:33.200
So only include sessions story when you want to log out manually and it's only temporary until we actually

05:33.200 --> 05:34.570
include log albertan.
