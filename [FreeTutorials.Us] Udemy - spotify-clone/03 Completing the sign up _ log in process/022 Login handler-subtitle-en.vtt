00:00.340 --> 00:01.410
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:04.240
So now we've completely done with our registered form.

00:04.260 --> 00:07.500
We've done on the foundations and we've made sure it works.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.830
Our emphasis is great.

00:09.060 --> 00:13.830
Now you don't do is fix the log in from because we haven't done anything with this at the moment so

00:13.830 --> 00:18.180
long informally just a really really simple nullah register form there was where there was a lot for

00:18.180 --> 00:20.820
us to do in the long form is pretty simple.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.920
Much like we have the register handed up here.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.860
But we only have the log in handle and up here it's been we made that a while ago.

00:26.940 --> 00:37.200
So if we open our and our site is open file open then go to includes then handlers and then log in handler

00:37.210 --> 00:38.170
right here.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.750
So this is the moment all it does is recognize when the log boom boom was press.

00:41.850 --> 00:45.150
So this is really really simple this isn't really not much to do.

00:45.150 --> 00:50.770
All you need do is just get the two values from the log in form the username and password.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.280
Remember we use the names to reference them so we need to use log in username and log in password to

00:56.280 --> 00:57.420
reference them.

00:57.420 --> 01:04.950
So go back to log in handler in all you say is user name equals sign and a score post by this group.

01:04.980 --> 01:13.740
This is how we get these very walls and inside their in username I write and then copy and paste up

01:13.740 --> 01:22.850
alone it's going to be password password this is going to be logmein Password right.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.190
Member they need to match here logon password.

01:26.680 --> 01:27.360
That's it.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.780
So don't have this on the form letter do is call our logon function which we haven't actually read.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.130
Yeah.

01:32.220 --> 01:35.680
So this would be our logging function.

01:36.030 --> 01:42.210
So let's write that function now to go in to a not BHB create a new function.

01:42.210 --> 01:50.220
Maybe the top of one right here the public function sharing log in like that.

01:50.420 --> 01:50.620
OK.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.160
It's going to take two parameters.

01:52.230 --> 01:54.600
They use a name so you end in their password.

01:54.630 --> 02:02.580
Peter what you know right now what we do is we're going to first encrypt the password so we say Peter

02:02.580 --> 02:03.000
will you.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.120
He goes m.d. FIVE.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.840
DO YOU LIKE THAT IS GONNA encrypt the password keys.

02:09.850 --> 02:13.800
Remember I told you that in the uses table the passwords appear like this.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.790
We're going encrypted.

02:14.820 --> 02:20.280
We're going to peck compare the password but this reads encrypt it first because if we type in this

02:20.280 --> 02:25.250
one here's password if we type in password it will output exactly the same string as at.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.990
So we in it endi five if the strings are the same we use the same password.

02:30.030 --> 02:34.970
So first we encrypt the password and then also have to do is check if it exists in as they will.

02:35.070 --> 02:40.740
So query he calls my escrow line and the score query like that.

02:40.820 --> 02:47.190
And this is going to be this arrow Khan connection variable and the query.

02:47.190 --> 02:54.260
He's just going to be select all from users where.

02:55.370 --> 03:03.450
The user name he calls you an I that read me saying quote See the side and.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.630
Password.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.540
He calls her quotes.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.330
Peter you like that.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.010
Okay.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.370
That's it.

03:11.380 --> 03:12.620
That's our query.

03:12.670 --> 03:17.690
And also tattoos check if they have a correct number of rows so check if it was successful or not.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.850
So if.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.570
May I ask you're alive.

03:21.610 --> 03:27.810
And the scorn rose and put a query in there like that.

03:28.060 --> 03:37.510
He calls one service one result found matching this username and password then just return true else

03:38.810 --> 03:40.120
it's false.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.770
Like that is a return true origin false.

03:43.790 --> 03:44.840
It defines one row.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.650
Return true for successful.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.620
If it finds anything other than one return false.

03:49.750 --> 03:55.780
But we also want to our one error message to say we're just going to side here put a ray in a score

03:55.810 --> 04:02.510
push just like we did below this error array like that.

04:03.070 --> 04:11.980
And then the m s going to be constants logmein failed like that would help create this one now so cravin

04:11.980 --> 04:17.890
could log in failed to go to constants class copy and paste one of these olmec from space below because

04:17.890 --> 04:21.220
these are our register error messages so this will be a log in error message.

04:21.330 --> 04:34.020
So log in failed and then rename this to your user name or password was in correct.

04:34.060 --> 04:38.150
Like that I write save an enneking just go to output this now.

04:38.290 --> 04:45.520
So copying basically the code lines we used to update the message below and paste that above the user

04:45.530 --> 04:47.230
name part of the log in form.

04:47.350 --> 04:55.690
Change this to write a new one we just created log in fail like that to log in failed and that should

04:55.690 --> 04:57.000
be it.

04:57.130 --> 05:02.310
Log in function is done was left to do now is check if it was correct and redirect them.

05:02.410 --> 05:09.910
But before we do that we do have to call this function Ohso result he calls a count which is a variable

05:09.910 --> 05:11.840
we created in the register file.

05:11.880 --> 05:20.880
Here count our own log in and then pass in the user name and also pass in the password like that says

05:20.890 --> 05:24.380
the function we just created and then reassembly.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.620
If result it holds true.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.000
Remember I told you you'd actually need to add this is true.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.850
That's fine but to be a bit more explicit we'll just say was all equal true.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.270
We're just going to redirect them.

05:37.310 --> 05:45.630
Header location indexed stop the HP And that's it.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.020
That's all I can do is go back and check this work now.

05:50.940 --> 05:56.140
So I try and log in with rescanning my password was password like that.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.020
If it redirects me it worked great.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.930
And this just check out our addresses worked.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.940
Scroll log in with the wrong user name and the wrong passwords.

06:03.950 --> 06:07.610
Well then there's our message.
