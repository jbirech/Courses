00:00.240 --> 00:01.360
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:06.480
So in last video I just verified that my information was being inserted in the database correctly which

00:06.480 --> 00:07.200
it is.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.750
But this might be the case for you.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.150
In fact is a very good chance it is your first time doing it.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.580
That the Days Night inserting and you don't know why.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.170
That's fine.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.760
I'll show you a way now that might make it easier for you to figure out what the problem is.

00:19.770 --> 00:25.620
So the first thing you do is compare the good columns here and make sure you have the right number of

00:25.620 --> 00:26.790
columns to your queries.

00:26.790 --> 00:29.930
If I go to microarray a quick this is my query right here.

00:30.120 --> 00:37.750
This insurgent uses this plies the query and I'll just verify that all of these column names match up.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.730
So we have a blank on Friday.

00:39.930 --> 00:48.450
Okay sir I.D. them user name first name last name used name first name last name email password sign

00:48.460 --> 00:53.060
update email password sign up day and then profile electronically.

00:53.310 --> 00:54.210
So maybe can't know.

00:54.210 --> 00:55.950
Make sure you have the right number.

00:55.950 --> 01:01.290
Second thing to do is to make sure you have single quotes around EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE.

01:01.290 --> 01:05.970
So if I was to do this in Acts then you leave one of the inquiries often outside of my variables.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.180
The query wouldn't work and it was felt was.

01:08.250 --> 01:12.090
So make sure you have single quotes around all your variables.

01:12.090 --> 01:15.060
The next thing you should do is make sure you have the commas.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.690
Okay if you leave a comma out it's going to work and some idea why Watson is thinking outside is pretty

01:21.690 --> 01:27.210
obvious but u.b. and you'll be surprised at how easy it is to do that no matter how long you've been

01:27.210 --> 01:27.950
doing this for.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.620
I always forget to insert the commas or forget a single quote.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.900
Happens all the time.

01:32.050 --> 01:36.930
So just go through and double check single quotes in Yardley commas and the next thing is one of the

01:36.930 --> 01:39.240
most likely things I do I forget to do.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.120
Is this closing parentheses right here.

01:42.120 --> 01:47.310
I always forget to include that so if you got this o'casey of your opening graffitis ebbie don't have

01:47.310 --> 01:48.340
a closing one now.

01:48.510 --> 01:49.420
It's not going to work.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.790
So make sure you have this one.

01:50.790 --> 01:56.310
This I forget quite often and then of course also make sure that you insert into the right table.

01:56.530 --> 01:56.940
Missouri.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.270
I'm certain to use a table.

01:58.270 --> 02:00.390
You've actually called users.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.950
If you don't know that you still can't figure it out.

02:02.970 --> 02:06.560
One thing to do is show you a way to debug this even further.

02:06.570 --> 02:09.150
So what you do is you take this query.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.330
Actually what I do.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.500
I removed that close in parentheses so that this will now fail.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.740
This crew is going to fail.

02:14.970 --> 02:23.270
So copy and paste the query like that and we're going to output this to the screen by saying airco.

02:25.200 --> 02:25.700
That.

02:25.710 --> 02:25.950
See.

02:25.970 --> 02:31.610
ECHO your query this way it will print out the query with all the variable values inserted as well.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.840
Okay so I'll show what that means now.

02:33.950 --> 02:37.130
So let's go back to my form register.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.660
It's being save.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.010
Yeah did.

02:41.290 --> 02:44.690
Bah bah.

02:44.770 --> 02:45.670
Oh Bert.

02:45.730 --> 02:51.250
Bert Simpson then part of the.

02:52.980 --> 02:59.070
G.m. Dot Com password password password also password.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.560
I'm going to sign up and remember this is going to fail.

03:02.710 --> 03:06.820
But what you see is this query echoed on the screen.

03:06.850 --> 03:07.870
I echo this query.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.770
So when I submit this now.

03:12.180 --> 03:13.940
You see the galaxy are busy.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.310
Here's a query with all the values inserted.

03:16.420 --> 03:21.100
Yeah all the variables have their values and what you want to do is take this whole thing.

03:23.510 --> 03:26.650
And insert it into this sequal tab.

03:26.690 --> 03:35.500
So for me a table is about a we go to go see Siegel and replace it here put it there and click go.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.820
So this is Tell Me I have an error in my syntax.

03:37.820 --> 03:42.290
The problem is along with all my columns being incorrect or the table name being correct so I can fix

03:42.290 --> 03:45.770
that if my error is different up or down then make it valid again.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.800
If my error is different less I forgot to include this.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.540
I forgot to name the table correctly I was trying to insert into user input of users.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.300
I'll skip this now.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.050
You see table user doesn't exist.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.270
So this tells me that the tables run.

04:02.390 --> 04:04.610
If I had one too many parameters.

04:04.610 --> 04:09.470
For example if I had an extra parameter here with something in there okay and I tried to insert this

04:09.470 --> 04:10.350
now.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.110
Column count as a match.

04:13.110 --> 04:16.970
I know what's on one too many or too little number of columns.

04:17.110 --> 04:23.390
So to summarize by echoing the query part not all this part just the query part.

04:23.950 --> 04:29.860
It shows on screen what the quote looks like with the variables inserted in OED copy and paste that

04:30.400 --> 04:35.640
into a sequel tab right here and click go and it will tell you in more detail what the errors are.
