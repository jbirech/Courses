00:00.300 --> 00:01.430
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:07.140
In the last video we got this inside uses is our function set up and now it's time to just make sure

00:07.140 --> 00:13.360
that this actually works window to our rest is up BHB form and just test this out and hope that it works.

00:13.430 --> 00:19.070
So go out and fill in our user names so I'll use that as my username I type my name.

00:19.110 --> 00:28.280
Reese Kenny outdo each g.m. can't reach an email.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.480
Khan It's not my actual email.

00:30.480 --> 00:40.110
By the way before even tries to email it and password Cisco password and then passwords again and sign

00:40.110 --> 00:44.000
up if it's successful we should be taken to the index page.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.770
So sign up.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.320
Okay so called underfire function.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.190
Insert user details.

00:51.250 --> 01:00.920
Am twenty one and we just check when out is a line twenty one and find function insert details I see.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.710
So I need to add this.

01:03.820 --> 01:07.310
This goes back to why I said earlier if you don't add this keyword it won't know.

01:07.420 --> 01:14.400
This refers to this class instance slept just say VAT and then I refresh the page.

01:14.710 --> 01:19.180
If you remember one of my earlier videos I briefly mention this confirmed formerie submission window

01:19.510 --> 01:24.340
and this basically means if you refresh the page if I click Continue it will resubmit the form with

01:24.340 --> 01:26.320
the exact same details added before.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.160
So is Emmy type.

01:27.150 --> 01:32.310
All our garages Click Continue and you'll see it worked.

01:32.690 --> 01:38.280
So unguessed go make sure the ante and it now so users.

01:38.680 --> 01:44.520
And there's my information you make sure it's okay so email there's the encrypted password or stockham

01:44.520 --> 01:48.970
else where I entered the password password and this is what changes it into.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.230
So it's encrypted it so even if I look in them demos I don't know what that password is.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.750
Sign up day it's fine and profile pic.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.280
Great.

01:57.310 --> 02:03.160
So all the all the information is added perfectly and s.r.l. out in ulladulla when you see the addy

02:03.160 --> 02:05.500
for this one was worn and one add a new user.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.280
You'll see the ideas too so I'll go back now.

02:08.310 --> 02:12.900
Area let's go back to up HP then I'll add.

02:12.970 --> 02:15.390
I'll do no honest go donkey kong.

02:15.390 --> 02:21.090
I go kicking donkey for a last name Kong email.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.290
K at ya who knows.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.450
Calm the K.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.200
Ya.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.560
Who's calm and then do passwords.

02:31.570 --> 02:38.200
Well actually I do password one once or changed one character just to show how it all changes.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.400
So the password is password 1 so I'll sign up now.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.180
It should be taken to index page.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.090
Okay it worked.

02:45.220 --> 02:50.070
Let me show you the user are refreshes table and you'll see automatically given the idea to.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.470
We don't have to do that.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.440
Let's go to here.

02:54.610 --> 02:56.550
Passwords So this was password.

02:56.650 --> 03:00.360
This was password one not so even changing from letter.

03:00.370 --> 03:03.330
The whole string changes completely.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.410
OK that's good because it makes it difficult to try and guess you know if this was password and if I

03:08.410 --> 03:11.310
changed one character it only changed slightly.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.470
You know it might be easy to guess.

03:12.490 --> 03:17.530
But the fact that if you change one character changes the outcome completely and later a little bit

03:17.530 --> 03:24.510
safer data that works in an next view I'll do is show you a really easy way of debugging something if

03:24.520 --> 03:25.180
it's gone wrong.

03:25.180 --> 03:28.320
So if you're trying to insert your data and it's not working you don't know why.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.480
What's next for the owner.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.510
I'll try and show you some easy ways to debug this out.
