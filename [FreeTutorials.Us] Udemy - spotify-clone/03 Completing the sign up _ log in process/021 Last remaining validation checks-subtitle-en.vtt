Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.200 --> 00:05.960
So by now we should hopefully have the values inserting your database correctly if not news let me know

00:06.080 --> 00:07.280
how happy I with that.

00:07.500 --> 00:14.210
But what we do now is go back to these parts that we said we do a couple of years ago the check if the

00:14.210 --> 00:16.880
user name exists and check if females exist.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.720
We waited until now because we went to went to if I had some information in there to check against.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.670
So let's go into the now it's really simple.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.280
There's not much to it.

00:26.280 --> 00:33.150
I'm going to only move this comment because I mean to do it now all you do is write a check user name

00:33.840 --> 00:38.600
querying like that check username equals priscu ally.

00:38.790 --> 00:51.420
Then the score query this like that and the query PA inaudible quote is going to be a select username

00:51.870 --> 00:53.690
from users.

00:55.140 --> 01:01.030
Where the user name he calls you end like that you.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.530
Is this very right here username.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.450
Don't forget with their last single quote.

01:05.580 --> 01:11.610
So we are selecting all the user names from the users table which match this which should only be one

01:11.770 --> 01:12.300
case.

01:12.330 --> 01:20.280
So some girl on underneath all you do is use an if statement but says if my Escuela underscore none

01:20.420 --> 01:27.970
and the school rose like that inside there put your check username query that you made above check username

01:27.980 --> 01:28.480
query.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.700
Same one goes in there.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.390
Okay.

01:30.660 --> 01:36.520
So if my esco I know Rose is not equal to zero.

01:36.770 --> 01:38.990
If is anything other than zero.

01:39.420 --> 01:47.160
Dan we're going to array bursch and inside there just like you were doing exactly the same things you

01:47.160 --> 01:48.710
do with these error messages.

01:48.750 --> 01:53.910
So this paro Error array like that.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.710
And then do can't stance.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.610
And and we haven't created this one yet but we'll create this them.

01:59.910 --> 02:03.940
And let's just call it user name taken like that.

02:04.110 --> 02:10.050
So when I pressed this arrange to there and then you can just return you only to return since this is

02:10.050 --> 02:12.420
the last one to go return after this anyway.

02:12.420 --> 02:15.770
But you can just put that in there just for some consistency.

02:15.810 --> 02:21.420
So we have to create this user take on one of our breaks open the Constance folder constants.

02:22.050 --> 02:27.150
It's in your classes folder and then you have to make a username take and wants to copy and paste one

02:27.150 --> 02:33.760
of those changes to your user name take it and make sure it matches what you inserted right there.

02:33.780 --> 02:41.810
Username taken and then we can just write this user name are ready.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.750
All ready exists like that.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.110
Okay.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.690
And then if you remember we also have to insert that here to get down to where we have the username

02:53.220 --> 02:59.580
copy and paste that and we can do prep using the user name taken like that.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.620
Okay.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.260
So that's utzon and it is actually sending e-mail.

03:04.260 --> 03:10.540
So copy and paste that don't go down to your validate e-mails one replace this comment with that change

03:10.550 --> 03:19.460
this to check e-mail query and then you'll say well no replace in here two for check e-mail query and

03:19.580 --> 03:28.430
here we're going to select the email from users where email equals e m like that which is the variable

03:28.430 --> 03:29.940
here.

03:30.300 --> 03:35.760
And if Check your macro number those is not equal to zero array perch.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.130
And this is going to be the email taken by that case go to Constance page and create that one.

03:43.380 --> 03:49.800
I'll paste it up here where the other e-mail addresses are so we can just call this email taken like

03:49.800 --> 03:50.520
that.

03:50.520 --> 03:55.550
This email is already in use.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.650
This email is already in use and ready.

03:59.670 --> 04:03.420
This email taken to the Constance glass now go to the register class.

04:03.420 --> 04:04.760
Scroll down to the email.

04:04.760 --> 04:11.310
Error messages are a copy and paste one those lines and changes to email taken like that.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.800
So if we're going to test this out now.

04:15.090 --> 04:19.600
If I try and use a username it's really taken care of them are in here.

04:19.610 --> 04:20.850
I also try to use an email.

04:20.860 --> 04:29.950
Sorry tag and so I think I use this app to email dot com seem calm.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.010
A password password.

04:34.510 --> 04:35.390
Password.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.550
Sign out now.

04:38.380 --> 04:39.770
This username what exists.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.720
And this email exists too.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.300
So there we go.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.170
It works.
