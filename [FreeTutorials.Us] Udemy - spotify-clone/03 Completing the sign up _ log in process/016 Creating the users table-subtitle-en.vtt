00:00.390 --> 00:01.490
Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:06.190
So last time we wrote this a function which allows us to remember the values from the previous forms

00:06.230 --> 00:06.900
mission.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.950
This is space use and to type out the names or use an image again if there's a problem with them.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.670
Now we're ready to move on to the database side of things including our users table.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.220
So go ahead the new tab and go to local host slash HP.

00:22.220 --> 00:25.650
My admin pay HP my admin.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.990
Now this is the front end for us.

00:27.030 --> 00:29.750
I ask you our database so go to that.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.800
If this doesn't work for you you can't see it.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.580
Make sure you have the my escarole database running OK.

00:36.630 --> 00:44.160
This needs to be running zengota new and then in here the Cray database we'll put the Davis name is

00:44.160 --> 00:45.710
whatever you call it it doesn't matter.

00:45.710 --> 00:52.980
Just I'll call it slow to fire I guess that's my name with the Get name of my website so Spotify he

00:53.130 --> 00:54.560
can call it whatever you want.

00:54.890 --> 00:59.520
OK now go and find this new them right here and you'll see there's no tables in there so it's give me

00:59.520 --> 01:01.000
the option to correct a will.

01:01.170 --> 01:07.780
So is I here type users were asking me the name of our table and go ahead and give this 8 columns.

01:08.110 --> 01:12.260
Okay A columns so we have a column templates here.

01:12.290 --> 01:17.400
This is how we create a table so the first column is going to have the name I.D. The type is going to

01:17.400 --> 01:18.450
stays in it.

01:18.630 --> 01:24.660
And then scroll along to the right and you see this a Irae here which stands for auto increment and

01:24.660 --> 01:29.620
change in the drop down to the left of it to primary primary key.

01:29.700 --> 01:35.860
And what this means the auto inkerman means that this value right here in this column that idea e what

01:35.880 --> 01:39.430
increment automatically every single time a new value was added.

01:39.480 --> 01:45.420
For example the first user to be entered into a state raised table will have the idea of 1 The second

01:45.420 --> 01:47.100
use will have the idea of 2.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.580
Okay this means we don't have to manually assign a value.

01:50.580 --> 01:56.820
For example if we got 50 people in the users table and our own is a new value I won't have to go and

01:56.820 --> 01:59.210
check to see how many values are to give it.

01:59.220 --> 02:04.440
The idea 51 it will automatically take the next number of cases which makes it a little bit easier for

02:04.440 --> 02:04.760
us.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.960
So you ought to increment and in the primary key means that this is going to be a unique value in the

02:09.960 --> 02:10.620
table.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.680
We know that this value can.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.280
You can never have the same idea.

02:14.290 --> 02:17.100
So you never have a user with the idea of 7 and another user.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.720
Also with the idea sabran there always have a unique idae.

02:20.830 --> 02:23.540
Okay so that's all you need to know about that for now.

02:23.550 --> 02:28.100
That will probably become a bit clearer as we start using this but the next column is going to be user

02:28.100 --> 02:34.800
name and the type of this is going to be varchar and then the length is going to be how many characters

02:34.800 --> 02:35.690
we allow them to have.

02:35.700 --> 02:39.250
So 25 characters for a username is probably good.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.670
And then next column is going to be first name like this.

02:42.690 --> 02:50.340
And there's also varchar varchar of text value and then the length of this let's say 15 because 50 sounds

02:50.700 --> 02:51.180
good.

02:51.230 --> 02:57.430
Aren't for a first name last name and then varchar 50 again.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.390
Feel free to adjust these values as you like email.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.700
I don't know what the good value would be for the email so we can just say no to Andrew.

03:07.700 --> 03:18.550
Just to be safe and password now the password is going to be a varchar 32 and the reason it's me thirsty

03:18.590 --> 03:23.310
is because we're going to encrypt this password before we put it into the database and the encryption

03:23.310 --> 03:27.800
method we're using is going to keep any encryption method we're using is going.

03:27.810 --> 03:32.850
Transform the password into a 32 character long string that probably won't make sense as some of you

03:32.850 --> 03:33.480
from now.

03:33.480 --> 03:41.640
But just 32 in there and explain that as we get there and then we have the sign up date so they signed

03:41.640 --> 03:44.990
up and this is going to be a date time not date.

03:45.150 --> 03:51.720
Date time which is a little bit further down their date time only differences date would just set the

03:51.720 --> 03:57.960
date and time will also take the time so date argued at length in there and the same at the top of that

03:57.960 --> 03:58.640
to say you don't have to.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.340
Better late than never in either.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.930
So length sent you don't need and length your date time should only be there for varchar you do.

04:06.930 --> 04:12.300
And then the last one is going to be a profile page which you read the link to their profile picture

04:12.330 --> 04:18.720
which you can assign to them via char and then just put 500 Finan because you don't know how it's going

04:18.720 --> 04:19.160
to be.

04:19.170 --> 04:24.500
The key is going to be the path to the file and we don't know how many carries will you have in that.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.730
And it's worth noting that if you use five hundred and all of these you won't use extra memory because

04:29.730 --> 04:31.750
it will only use as much memories it needs.

04:31.770 --> 04:37.400
For example if I put 250 in there it wouldn't use any more memory than if I put 25.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.550
All it means is you restricted from putting in that many characters so I can't but twice six characters

04:41.550 --> 04:44.160
in here only uses as much memory as the text.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.950
This is at the field so it doesn't use any more memory.

04:46.950 --> 04:47.780
They ask.

04:48.110 --> 04:48.660
And that's it.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.260
Go ahead and click save and that is our users table Don.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.270
So click on use as well.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.990
You can see there's no results in here yet.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.080
But that's that's it.
