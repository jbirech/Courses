00:00.650 --> 00:01.920
Hey guys welcome back.

00:02.060 --> 00:06.560
So last time we created our users table which of course has no values at the moment so there's you see

00:06.560 --> 00:07.660
any results in there.

00:07.820 --> 00:12.890
But now we're going to do is actually prepare to insert the values the user enters in the form into

00:12.890 --> 00:13.840
the users table.

00:13.970 --> 00:14.580
OK.

00:14.780 --> 00:19.340
Before we do that though we need to set up the configuration file which allow us to actually talk to

00:19.350 --> 00:21.410
them secure our database.

00:21.740 --> 00:28.100
And this is actually really really easy and just create a new file and then save this and we save it

00:28.100 --> 00:29.160
and include.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.640
And then just call it config dot the h be like that.

00:33.650 --> 00:40.220
So in the includes voda configure BHP now opening peter out like that.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.360
And at the top we're going to say our and the score start like that.

00:46.490 --> 00:52.100
And the school staff and what this does it turns on output buffering which you don't know a whole lot

00:52.100 --> 00:56.100
about at the moment if you just dine out of BHP primps ignore this.

00:56.340 --> 01:02.150
And basically what it does is one of the BHP page loads it will send this to the server in pieces.

01:02.360 --> 01:06.030
This just means way until we have all the data for sending it to the server.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.070
Like I said you don't know a whole lot about this.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.670
You can look it up if you want more information.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.640
But in my experience having this here makes me a little bit easier to work with insaf.

01:13.650 --> 01:19.130
It might save you some problems in future but if you don't stand that juice just write down anyway it

01:19.130 --> 01:20.610
doesn't matter too much.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.850
I guess it underscore or start.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.880
And then we'll just put timezone.

01:26.720 --> 01:34.310
We have to set the time zone because date and the score default time zone is set.

01:34.310 --> 01:40.770
That should be set date and this a default underscore time zone underscore set and then hey convert

01:40.820 --> 01:44.220
whatever you want but I'm going to put Europe.

01:46.010 --> 01:48.330
London like that.

01:48.570 --> 01:55.980
Are you going find your own timezone and you can just put the HP times like that.

01:57.210 --> 02:00.400
And you get lists of supported timezones right here.

02:00.900 --> 02:01.250
OK.

02:01.260 --> 02:04.740
So we go see all the time zones and you can just choose one.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.730
So click on Europe for example.

02:07.270 --> 02:08.680
Then you get all of them here.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.430
So I chose Europe London right here.

02:11.430 --> 02:14.820
Feel free to choose whatever you want and then you just put it down there.

02:14.820 --> 02:19.480
And this just sets in and this is just you say that when we store times in the database we get there.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.940
We have a good time and I'm going to pull our connection very well from my escarole database so we'll

02:24.960 --> 02:30.750
call it Khan and you'll see that we use this for free range everything we do going forward in say my

02:30.750 --> 02:43.050
escarole I underscore connect them in brackets Purt local host which is your server and then per route

02:43.080 --> 02:48.180
which is a user name and it's a default username could we ever say username yet so just call it rude

02:48.750 --> 02:50.550
and then an empty string.

02:50.550 --> 02:54.660
This is password by default we don't have a password in our database.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.350
And then what have you called your my Ask your old database.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.140
So I called mine Slotter 5 right here somewhere right.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.320
Spotify in there.

03:04.440 --> 03:04.870
Right.

03:04.950 --> 03:13.740
So of the 7 we have the user name the password and then the database name all going to an outage output

03:13.740 --> 03:16.090
an error message if it didn't work.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.690
So it failed to connect the database.

03:18.690 --> 03:26.230
So my Esker alive and the score connect e r n no error.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.230
No it's just basically there.

03:29.370 --> 03:33.360
So the error will be stored in the in this copy copying base in that part right there.

03:33.450 --> 03:44.730
And then if there's an error we're going to say airco fail to act like that and then append the arrested.

03:44.730 --> 03:48.060
With this the dart in BHP appends strings together.

03:48.060 --> 03:53.730
So this strength appended with the actual error message around and to test if this works we would have

03:53.730 --> 03:55.520
to create a reference to this file.

03:55.620 --> 04:04.200
So go back to registered up BHP at the top here the very first line underneath the BHP tag Purt include

04:05.250 --> 04:10.180
in there includes slash config dock.

04:10.200 --> 04:17.010
The HP just like that or I save that and refresh the page.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.680
If you don't see any error messages you should be okay.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.230
So this worked.

04:23.850 --> 04:28.410
If for example I changed the name of this database now to something which doesn't exist and then go

04:28.410 --> 04:29.290
back refresh the page.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.740
I should see an error message.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.010
Yeah.

04:32.130 --> 04:32.410
See.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.360
Unknown database with that name I see.

04:35.370 --> 04:36.750
We know that he's calling this.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.470
So change it back now to whatever your date is called.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.600
So you shouldn't see any errors and that's it.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.410
Now we can finally communicate with my escarole their race.
