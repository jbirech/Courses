00:01.110 --> 00:06.030
Let's talk a little bit about our roadmap to developing our first application the first thing I'm going

00:06.030 --> 00:10.980
to install do is install a couple of dependencies and these are going to be different depending on your

00:10.980 --> 00:12.240
operating system.

00:12.390 --> 00:19.170
So you might be taking this course on either a Mac or Windows or Linux machine depending on what machine

00:19.170 --> 00:19.680
you're on.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.300
We're going to go through a different set of installation directions to get started with couple of dependencies

00:26.040 --> 00:27.720
in this video or this me in this course.

00:27.720 --> 00:36.420
I've provided directions for getting started with Iowa apps on Mac Android on Mac and Android on Windows.

00:36.420 --> 00:41.490
Depending on your operating system you will take one of those tracks and go through to completion.

00:41.490 --> 00:48.420
SUSSMAN The first thing that we do after that we're going to install Yes Slint Yes lint is a system

00:48.420 --> 00:53.270
for automatically catching errors in the code that we write with javascript.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.860
This is optional insulation.

00:54.870 --> 00:59.960
You don't have to use Yeslam if you don't want to but I highly recommend going through it in this course

00:59.970 --> 01:04.470
I've provided e-wrestling installation directions for a couple of different common code editors and

01:04.470 --> 01:09.480
we'll walk through the installation one by one depending upon which code editor you use.

01:09.930 --> 01:15.990
After all that setup we will finally get started by generating a Riak native application and then boom

01:16.080 --> 01:17.330
we're going to start coding.

01:17.640 --> 01:23.010
So the one thing I want to just kind of temper expectations right now are set expectations with reac

01:23.010 --> 01:23.430
native.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.130
Unfortunately there really is a lot of set up to go through.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.190
I just I love starting off tutorials by working on example right away.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.180
Like in the first section or two but unfortunately with re-act native We have to do the set up ahead

01:36.180 --> 01:39.180
of time because we can't write any code without it.

01:39.630 --> 01:43.860
So I encourage you to stay strong we're going to take power through all of this set up and then we're

01:43.860 --> 01:47.930
going to start with the first application the first out that we're going to work on.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.210
It really looks awesome.

01:49.230 --> 01:51.200
I'm very happy with how it turned out.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.500
So I encourage you to tough it out through the installation and then we're going to start with the first

01:55.500 --> 01:56.470
application.

01:56.850 --> 02:01.320
Let's get started in the next section we're going to walking through installation directions.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.230
If you are on Mac with and you want to develop iOS applications so I will catch you in the next section
