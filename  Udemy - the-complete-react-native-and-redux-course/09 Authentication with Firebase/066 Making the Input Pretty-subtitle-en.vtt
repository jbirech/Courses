WEBVTT

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.310
We're ready for our last step inside of our input component.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.430
All we have to do is add some styling to style the view the text which is in your label and the text

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.270
input itself.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.140
So just a little bit more to adding our styling will do the same thing as previous out in a styles object

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.500
at the bottom of the file.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.090
So we'll say Clontz styles is an empty object.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.300
And I think we're going to end up with three styles inside of here.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.760
We'll end up with one for our label one for the text input and one for the overall container.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.610
So the overall view tag right here.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.870
So I'm going to immediately place the names of these three styles that I expect to have have an input

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.200
style.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.960
We will have a label style

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.170
and finally a container style as well.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.840
All right we've got a decent amount of Taipans Let's get to it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.160
First off our input style will have a color of 0 0 0 will give it a padding rights of five.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.850
So this is going to make sure that it stands off from the left hand edge of rigor.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.190
We don't want to beat up too closely so we just want to make sure that is a little bit of standoff wants

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.000
to do a padding left of five and then a font size of 18.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
This additional font size of this larger font size right here is going to make sure the users can very

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.830
clearly see the text that they're entering into this field.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.780
Next we'll add in a line height of 23.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.050
The purpose of line height is not necessarily tied to the font size.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.300
It's about how much space is in between each line of text.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.800
So by increasing the line height here it's going to make the text inside that input just kind of stand

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.960
out a little bit more.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.910
Finally And we're going to talk exactly the purpose of this one right here.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.230
Add in a flex of two and we're going to come back to that in just a second.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.500
So bear with me next to our label Styer style only a couple of here we will dial up the font size as

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.050
well to 18.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.800
I'm going to add in a bunch of padding left to make sure that the label stands apart from the left hand

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.030
border over here and then I'm going to give this a flex one.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.590
So let's take a second and discuss these flex values.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.890
I want you to take notice that both the input and the text are children of The View tag right here because

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.790
they're both children.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.470
They're siblings of each other might be a better way of putting it.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.120
Whenever we have siblings with a flex property designated on the style objects the flex property is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.650
how we allocate or a proportion available space to each one.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.940
So the rule that we use is we say for each sibling in this case input style and label style we add up

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.290
the values of flex.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.910
So two plus one that totals three.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.340
Now we take two divided by the total of three.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.930
That means that two thirds of the available space will be allocated to the input style and one divided

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.310
by three or one third will be added allocated to the label style.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.650
As soon as we render this inside the simulator.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.480
And as soon as we test it out I think that's going to start to make a lot of sense.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.800
Let's finish up the style in here and see what it looks like.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
So the last thing we have to do is our content or style and this container style is going to be applied

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.080
to the overall view tag.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.550
So for our container container style we'll add a height of 40 flecks of wine to make sure that it fills

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.480
up all the available space that there is and then we want to make sure that the label and the text input

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.030
themselves show up alongside each other.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.650
So kind of in the horizontal or road direction.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.320
So to make these two items lineup in the road direction will give the container style a flex direction

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.580
of road.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.140
Finally we will align items center to make sure that the items are lined up vertically.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.190
All right so no lesson you have to do is take these three style properties and apply them to the different

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.360
tags in here.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.700
So again we're going to use a little bit of destructuring to make that happen.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.630
So we'll pull our input style our label style and our container style and we're going to pull all those

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.230
from our styles.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640
Object.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.310
And then we'll apply them to each individual tag.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:40.210
So the overall view gets a style of container style that text gets a style of label style.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.770
And finally the text input gets a style of input style.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.150
All right one last thing before we start in the browser we still do not have a label here.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.900
So let's flip back to our loggin form where this input component is being used and make sure that we

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.110
pass the input a label to use in here.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.320
So when we go back to my log and form you find my input and I make sure I pass it a label as well.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.910
So I'll give it a label of what say.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.140
Email All right.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.970
So now is it time for the moment of truth.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.860
We will refresh the simulator and.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.500
OK.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.160
Well you know what.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.200
We're close.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.620
But it looks like I probably made a typo in here I've got a warning down at the bottom.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.320
Let's double check our property name.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.090
It's giving me an error on a line specifically or a warning I should say.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.470
And so I made a mistake here that should be a line items.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.080
I'm almost positive I said a line item so I apologize for the confusion there.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.200
So let's do another refresh.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.660
All right.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.110
Now this is looking pretty good.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.000
Now I should be able to click in here somewhere.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.050
Well it looks like perhaps there's still a little bit of a mistake in here.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.770
So let's continue in the next section and figure out exactly why we can't click on the text input here

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.990
.
