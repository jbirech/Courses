WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:07.430
In the last section we set up our firebase account and we enabled email and password for authentication.

00:07.710 --> 00:12.990
That's only half the set up though as we still have to set up the firebase client library so we can

00:12.990 --> 00:15.060
interact with their servers.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.200
So we do a little bit set up now but don't worry the set apart isn't too bad.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.470
It's just more installation of modules.

00:22.950 --> 00:28.530
So first thing we're going to do is install the firebase library as an NPM module.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.420
So I'm going to open up my command line.

00:30.440 --> 00:41.020
I'm inside of my project directory of author right now and I will NPM install dash dash save firebase.

00:41.050 --> 00:46.270
So again this is going to reach out to the NPM registry and install firebase as a dependency.

00:46.270 --> 00:50.640
After that we will be able to set up firebase inside of our application.

00:50.740 --> 00:57.820
Now when we created our firebase project like over the firebase consul here when we made this authentication

00:57.820 --> 01:04.570
thing it created a distinct bucket of data for our project that sits on the firebase servers.

01:04.570 --> 01:10.690
So now in theory on the firebase servers there are some like big folder or bucket where all of our data

01:10.690 --> 01:12.210
is going to set.

01:12.400 --> 01:19.390
So to set up our firebase library locally we have to tell it exactly what bucket to go reach out and

01:19.390 --> 01:22.950
try to get access to on the firebase servers.

01:23.270 --> 01:23.580
OK.

01:23.590 --> 01:29.410
So my firebase library is done installing and we are now going to tell it hey when you boot up please

01:29.410 --> 01:33.410
try to connect to this very specific bucket of data.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.080
That's the goal here.

01:35.110 --> 01:39.950
So inside of our app component we're going to place that initialization code inside of here.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.350
We will first import firebase from firebase.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.980
So this gives us access to the firebase library.

01:48.460 --> 01:54.550
And then we are going to set up some initialization or configuration for it and we need to think for

01:54.550 --> 01:57.830
a second what is the what is the best time to do set up like that.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.890
You know when's the best time in our application to do that set up.

02:01.450 --> 02:07.180
And so I would say well maybe the best time to that set up would be right before this component right

02:07.180 --> 02:14.670
here this app component gets rendered to the screen of our device to get a handle or a hook on that

02:14.950 --> 02:16.960
we can use a lifecycle method.

02:17.020 --> 02:25.720
So add the lifecycle method component will mount and inside of here is where we will do our firebase

02:25.720 --> 02:27.140
initialization.

02:27.340 --> 02:34.230
Remember that lifecycle methods are methods that are automatically invoked inside of our component.

02:34.270 --> 02:39.420
All we have to do is define the method and if we define it it will be automatically called.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.010
All right.

02:41.080 --> 02:48.490
So last step we are going to go back over to firebase and on the right hand topsides here you can find

02:48.640 --> 02:55.360
a button that says web setup and click web setup and this gives me a bunch of stuff to copy paste into

02:55.360 --> 02:56.820
my application.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.650
Note that this is all set up.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.750
Assuming that you're using a way or like you're in a web environment so it's got some script tags and

03:04.750 --> 03:06.280
all that kind of good stuff.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.180
And we're clearly not in a web environment we're using re-act need.

03:09.190 --> 03:14.280
So we're going to kind of just copy paste a section out of this.

03:14.620 --> 03:19.170
I'm going to grab just this configuration object right here.

03:19.190 --> 03:23.740
It's just everything from the opening curly brace to the closing Crilley brace.

03:23.740 --> 03:29.000
And then I'm going to copy it and we'll pull it back over to our component will mount.

03:29.410 --> 03:38.680
And inside of here we'll call firebase initialiser out and I'm going to paste in excuse me I'm going

03:38.680 --> 03:44.410
to paste in that configuration and I'm also make sure I delete the dangling semicolon here.

03:47.820 --> 03:48.340
OK.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.300
And the last thing is.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.850
Yes lint really wants to have single quotes and I am happy to oblige.

03:53.910 --> 03:57.240
So I'm going to replace all these with single quotes like so.

03:59.710 --> 04:00.350
OK.

04:00.820 --> 04:04.730
Well the last thing you know I put that import statement as the last statement.

04:04.750 --> 04:08.220
It should really be above any import statements for stuff that we write.

04:08.230 --> 04:15.820
That was a mistake on my side some is going to cut this line and move it above the head or import.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.370
There we go much better.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.270
OK.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.600
So that's that's it all.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.420
That's all we had to do for our firebase setup.

04:21.430 --> 04:27.850
So at this point in time we have installed the firebase library and we gave it a little bit of configuration

04:27.850 --> 04:30.610
that told it hey we've already got a project set up for you.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.950
There's some bucket of data on the firebase servers that you need to make access to.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.680
And this is the configuration that makes that happen.

04:39.370 --> 04:43.750
So I think that we are just about all set out to start working on our form.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.910
Let's continue on the next section and start working on that Sign-Up form
