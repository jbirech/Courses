WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:03.790
In unless section we finished some firebase set up.

00:03.810 --> 00:06.180
We're not going to come back to firebase for a little bit.

00:06.180 --> 00:10.740
Instead we're going to focus on putting together our sign in form with some really good styling for

00:10.740 --> 00:16.050
now and then we'll come back to firebase and actually wrap up the authentication piece.

00:16.110 --> 00:20.670
So one of the first considerations that we need to make for this sign of form is whether or not we should

00:20.670 --> 00:26.340
create a new component to house the form itself or whether or not we should just place the form directly

00:26.340 --> 00:27.600
inside this app components.

00:27.600 --> 00:34.570
I'm talking about like literally placing a text input tag directly inside this component.

00:34.650 --> 00:40.800
I mean to suggest that we create a separate component and here's why the sign form should only be visible

00:40.800 --> 00:44.590
for a portion of the time inside our app sometimes will show the form.

00:44.610 --> 00:44.910
Right.

00:44.910 --> 00:48.570
Like when the user first starts the app up but other times you won't.

00:48.570 --> 00:54.120
So when a user successfully signs in and it's going to be easier to hide it if we put the form into

00:54.120 --> 00:56.490
a separate component.

00:56.490 --> 01:02.250
So with that in mind I'm going to create a new file inside of my components directory not inside of

01:02.250 --> 01:06.410
common just inside of components called log in form

01:09.340 --> 01:10.480
so log in form.

01:10.480 --> 01:17.010
Its sole purpose is going to be to How's everything having to do with entering a email entering a password

01:17.170 --> 01:19.650
and then trying to sign the user in.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.630
So inside this file Let's get started with a little bit of boilerplate.

01:23.680 --> 01:28.600
I am going to make this a class based component for reasons that we'll talk about in just a little bit.

01:29.120 --> 01:40.930
What import react and component from react and then just view right now from re-act native then we'll

01:40.930 --> 01:44.230
create our component class of log and form

01:47.570 --> 01:54.990
you to make sure I've got components spelt correctly and add my render method from which will return

01:55.380 --> 01:57.930
a single view tag for right now.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.060
Then at the bottom we can export.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.340
Default log in form.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.210
OK so there's the boiler plate right now.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.430
I'm hoping that at some point in time getting this boy the play together is going to become second nature

02:11.430 --> 02:14.310
because it feels like we write it a lot.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.990
Yup that's absolutely correct.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.650
We definitely write this thing a lot.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.330
This boy that played out.

02:20.970 --> 02:25.340
All right as a quick reminder log in form Here's a diagram for it.

02:25.350 --> 02:28.010
We need to have that kind of a card.

02:28.050 --> 02:31.680
The card section component and definitely the button component as well.

02:31.890 --> 02:38.130
So I think of our next step will be to place our reusable components or at least import them and then

02:38.130 --> 02:43.990
kind of scaffold out what we want the blog in the form to look like we're going to need one card.

02:44.070 --> 02:49.770
And I think it's going to contain three card sections one for e-mail one for password and one for the

02:49.770 --> 02:50.830
log in button.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.290
So let's get started with that now.

02:54.030 --> 03:04.800
At the very top we'll import our button card and it card section from the common directory and notice

03:04.800 --> 03:06.920
that I'm sane in the current directory.

03:06.930 --> 03:13.060
Find the common folder because this law enforcement is already inside the components directory.

03:13.080 --> 03:18.750
Notice all this is a lot nicer import statement than if we had three separate import statements all

03:18.750 --> 03:20.040
coming from the common folders.

03:20.040 --> 03:27.450
So again I really like this kind of pattern here is kind of approach Nabel and just kind of a little

03:27.450 --> 03:32.590
bit of scaffolding of what you know with the different cards and cards section area should be.

03:32.940 --> 03:38.390
So then take out the view tag right now and replace it with a card tag.

03:38.620 --> 03:44.580
So that's going to give us that kind of nice looking wrapper as a nice shadow on it has some margin

03:44.580 --> 03:46.200
on the left and right hand sides.

03:46.200 --> 03:53.760
Just something that looks nice and inside of here we'll make our three separate card sections so card

03:53.760 --> 03:54.750
section one.

03:54.930 --> 04:00.960
And right now I just can use self-closing tags because I don't have anything to put inside the first

04:00.960 --> 04:02.750
two just yet.

04:03.570 --> 04:08.940
And then for the last one this is going to be the card section that's going to How's that button.

04:08.940 --> 04:15.690
And we could probably create that button right now because we already know what text it's going to require

04:16.010 --> 04:19.410
So I just going to put in Lagann like so.

04:20.160 --> 04:27.150
So we've got card three card sections in the last card section has a button tag inside it.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.830
Finally we need to make sure this component actually gets shown inside of our app.

04:30.990 --> 04:33.440
So again flip back to our app component.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.140
Import this form and show it.

04:36.330 --> 04:48.360
So if the top will imports loggin form from components log in form like so and then we're going to show

04:48.360 --> 04:50.180
it inside of our application.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.170
So I've got my view tag I've got my header tag.

04:53.370 --> 04:54.860
I probably don't need the text anymore.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.190
It was really just there to get us started.

04:57.360 --> 05:03.850
So we're going to take out the text tag and replace it with an instance of the logon form like so.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.330
All right.

05:05.350 --> 05:09.600
Now of course as I mentioned earlier we probably don't want to show the logon form 100 percent of the

05:09.600 --> 05:14.670
time but we will just use this shortcut for now and we'll come back later and figure out how we're going

05:14.670 --> 05:17.560
to toggle whether or not the log in form is visible.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.810
OK time see if everything worked out.

05:19.950 --> 05:24.530
I'm going to flip back to the simulator refresh and see how we're doing.

05:28.820 --> 05:35.450
First time we import stuff always takes a while for it transpired especially since my laptop is not

05:35.450 --> 05:36.610
the newest one in the world.

05:36.650 --> 05:39.340
So it's kind of a I'm never giving up.

05:39.350 --> 05:43.770
I'm just going to let the thing go while it is running though I do need to do a little bit of clean

05:43.770 --> 05:44.060
up.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.890
I've still got the unused text tagged which we just deleted.

05:47.220 --> 05:50.550
So I'm going to take that out just for good housekeeping.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.070
And there we go.

05:52.070 --> 05:52.390
All right.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.410
So much better.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.690
I've got one card section to section.

05:56.690 --> 06:01.850
And the third one here and the third one presently just houses the log in button which if we press doesn't

06:01.850 --> 06:03.200
do anything just yet.

06:03.590 --> 06:08.330
So let's continue the next section and figure out exactly what we're going to place inside of these

06:08.340 --> 06:09.840
card sections.
