00:01.130 --> 00:04.220
In the last section we added some styling to our input component.

00:04.220 --> 00:08.260
But when we render it inside the simulator I wasn't able to click in here.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.740
I apologize I made a little bit of a mistake.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.940
We added on the style of input style.

00:12.950 --> 00:17.340
I completely forgot that we had already added on the style of a height and a with on here.

00:17.540 --> 00:23.660
So whenever we add two props with the same name the earlier prop is overwritten by a later one.

00:23.870 --> 00:29.320
So I'm just going to remove the style that's hard to clear with the height of 20 and with 100.

00:29.510 --> 00:36.350
Save it and now it will refresh the simulator and actually tap in here and start typing some text.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.960
Ok so back to where we need to be.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.980
One thing I want to point out here is the flex values really quick.

00:43.070 --> 00:50.660
So remember because we gave the input a flex of two and a label style of one the input is occupying

00:50.660 --> 00:56.930
two thirds of the available space whereas the label is only applying or I should say occupying one third

00:56.930 --> 01:00.120
of the space.

01:00.190 --> 01:05.860
So just a little bit more challenge inside here a little bit more housekeeping to do on this input before

01:05.860 --> 01:07.800
we can move on to that password one.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.500
First I want you to notice one really annoying thing here.

01:11.620 --> 01:21.160
If I put in something like you know maybe I entry email and I've got a e-mail of like bottle at gmail

01:21.160 --> 01:26.040
dot com as a bad example let's see if I can yeah.

01:26.050 --> 01:27.930
Wait no.

01:28.250 --> 01:28.520
OK.

01:28.550 --> 01:29.590
Well if I just do.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.120
There go.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.830
Getting that right there you get the idea.

01:32.240 --> 01:39.320
If I type in a word that is not valid iOS is going to try to auto correct my value here and I really

01:39.320 --> 01:44.980
very likely never want to show my users some auto correct information around their e-mail address like

01:45.020 --> 01:54.140
you know it's incredibly common for people to have an e-mail like I don't know super Princess 32 or

01:54.140 --> 01:58.850
something like that and I don't want to start to show user some validation around their e-mail address

01:58.850 --> 02:00.450
because it could be completely valid.

02:00.470 --> 02:06.560
You know as long as it has a fully qualified domain at the end here so would be really nice to not have

02:06.560 --> 02:10.710
any default autocorrect on here to handle that.

02:10.760 --> 02:17.290
We can just pass a prompt to the text input here to disable that default auto correct functionality.

02:17.330 --> 02:26.820
So I'm going to pass in a additional prompt to the text input of auto correct false.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.310
So this says hey don't don't try to auto correct anything here.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.120
People are going to have crazy e-mails.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.370
Don't worry about it.

02:33.380 --> 02:38.800
So now if I start to do like you know test one or whatever.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.530
Ok I made a mistake.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.300
I may be kept busy.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.450
Let's get a shot.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.190
Just one.

02:47.230 --> 02:47.850
OK.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.960
My apologies my my mistake there.

02:50.090 --> 02:55.570
Autocorrect should have a capital C not a lowercase c and we just have to pass it the value false and

02:55.570 --> 03:01.010
then we won't get any validation here or any messages that the users passing in something funky.

03:01.030 --> 03:06.490
Now the other requirement here for e-mail tag we had said that we wanted to show a placeholder to the

03:06.490 --> 03:10.930
user something to approximate Hey you're supposed to put your email address in here or something beyond

03:10.930 --> 03:14.110
just the text or the label that says email.

03:14.140 --> 03:19.320
So to add a placeholder to a text input also very easy to add it just like auto correct.

03:19.330 --> 03:27.610
We just need to add an additional prompt to the text input so I'll add a additional Propp of placeholder

03:28.390 --> 03:33.970
and we need to make sure that we specify this placeholder on the fly or make it available for configuration

03:33.970 --> 03:35.330
from the parent component.

03:35.590 --> 03:40.780
Because I don't want to make sure this thing I know I don't want to hard code email in here if I heartwood

03:40.780 --> 03:44.900
e-mail in here all of a sudden my input component is no longer usable.

03:45.220 --> 03:53.520
So instead we will receive a placeholder prop from our parent component.

03:53.550 --> 03:56.200
So get it out onto our props list right here.

03:56.870 --> 04:03.290
A placeholder like so and then we're going to flip back over to our log and form and make sure that

04:03.290 --> 04:05.480
we actually add that placeholder in.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.090
So here is my input.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.760
I will add in a placeholder.

04:10.080 --> 04:15.200
And you know you might think well put in place placeholder like email or something like that I love

04:15.200 --> 04:20.420
the pattern of placing in some realistic input for the user some realistic prompt.

04:20.450 --> 04:26.470
So instead of give them a more realistic prompt of you maybe your e-mail looks like user fetchmail that

04:26.470 --> 04:31.070
column just something to guide the user into thinking oh that's what this form of this input should

04:31.070 --> 04:34.540
be it should be something that looks like an email address.

04:34.970 --> 04:40.860
So now you refresh the simulator we see we've got a very nice looking placeholder in there right now

04:41.170 --> 04:45.830
and it's very easy for the user to understand OK you know I should probably click in there and start

04:45.830 --> 04:52.470
entering something in our voice has been a great little advance here.

04:52.490 --> 04:57.370
I think there's just one last little piece of housekeeping I want to take care of back inside of our

04:57.370 --> 04:58.470
log and form.

04:58.520 --> 05:04.900
We are currently stashing the value of the e-mail input on a piece of state called text.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.280
Now that's completely fine.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.010
You know nothing bad about that.

05:08.010 --> 05:11.780
Member the names of all these state properties are completely arbitrary.

05:11.810 --> 05:17.600
We can make them anything we want but very soon we're going to want to add in a nother text input to

05:17.600 --> 05:20.040
handle our email field as well.

05:20.150 --> 05:24.980
And at that point in time it's not really going to make sense to have like a text besides state and

05:24.990 --> 05:27.610
like password text or something like that.

05:27.650 --> 05:33.380
So I'm going to choose to just rename the prop here from or excuse me the name of the state property

05:33.680 --> 05:36.350
from text to e-mail.

05:36.410 --> 05:41.960
So it's very clear to anyone who looks at this in the future that this piece of state right here contains

05:41.960 --> 05:45.570
the user's e-mail address that they're trying to type in.

05:45.860 --> 05:49.630
So we need to also update some of our code down here as well.

05:49.850 --> 05:55.720
The input tag should now be pulling its value from this dot state DOT e-mail.

05:55.970 --> 06:01.760
And when we receive some amount of text from the onchange text callback we're no longer going to set

06:01.790 --> 06:03.770
a prop called Text.

06:03.810 --> 06:06.220
We're going to set a prop called e-mail.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.340
So take that text and set it on a proper e-mail.

06:10.370 --> 06:15.850
One other thing if you want to rename this Propp to e-mail as well and then maintain the shortened syntax

06:15.890 --> 06:18.560
that's completely you know definitely good.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.110
Good factor as well.

06:20.420 --> 06:23.100
Let's go ahead and do that just for the sake of completion.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.130
So we're going to say that rather than calling this argument text.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.320
I want to call it e-mail.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.340
Just a quick reminder in javascript.

06:30.350 --> 06:32.780
You can name your props anything you want.

06:32.810 --> 06:33.940
You can remain them on the fly.

06:33.940 --> 06:36.160
Doesn't matter whatever you want to be called.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.330
Go for it.

06:38.380 --> 06:43.290
Are you saying the argument did not mean to say Propp and the argument can be whatever I want to call

06:43.290 --> 06:43.730
it.

06:44.010 --> 06:46.490
Props have to be specially named anyways.

06:46.830 --> 06:49.510
So now I've got just the email Propp.

06:49.620 --> 06:57.180
I will remove the text tag and I'm relying on a little bit of E.S. 6 again of getting this expanded

06:57.180 --> 07:01.820
out to a full object of email Colan e-mail.

07:02.030 --> 07:02.880
All right.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.900
I think that's just about it for collecting e-mails from our user.

07:06.930 --> 07:09.200
So we're definitely in a good spot here.

07:09.210 --> 07:14.550
Let's continue in the next section and start handling a password from the user as well.
