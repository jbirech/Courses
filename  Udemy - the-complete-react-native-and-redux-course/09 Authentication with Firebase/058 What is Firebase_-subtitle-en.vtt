00:00.920 --> 00:05.910
In the last section we set up some infrastructure for a reusable components to be able to import them

00:05.910 --> 00:07.030
more easily.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.860
So with a single line all the components we need at least for the common ones.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.460
Now continue by getting set up with firebase.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.070
But before we do let's answer that nagging question what in the world is firebase wasn't going to do

00:20.070 --> 00:21.600
for us.

00:21.720 --> 00:27.630
So we're going to exploit our with this amazingly simple diagram right here because what firebase really

00:27.630 --> 00:33.840
does is amazingly simple firebase can be thought of as an online database that will connect directly

00:33.840 --> 00:34.830
to our app.

00:35.130 --> 00:41.340
As we develop or publish our app we can connect to this online data store and be automatically notified

00:41.370 --> 00:45.630
of any changes to our data by other users of our application.

00:45.630 --> 00:51.360
So whenever some amount of data changes we can decide to update our different components and present

00:51.360 --> 00:53.940
that new information to our users.

00:53.940 --> 01:00.660
Firebase is not only about moving data between firebase the database and our affiliate application though

01:01.290 --> 01:08.850
it can also be used for analytics file storage or the feature that we're interested in right now authentication.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.550
So I can talk all day about firebase but it is certainly one of those concepts where you just have to

01:14.550 --> 01:15.870
walk through it yourself.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.340
So let's sign up for an account and get started.

01:19.690 --> 01:30.730
First I'll open up my browser and pop open a new tab and I can go to firebase dot Google dot com.

01:30.760 --> 01:36.730
Now I need to assume that you've already got a Google account like you know General Gmail or just something

01:36.730 --> 01:41.290
like that account and I assume that you have one if you do not have a Google account you'll need to

01:41.290 --> 01:46.720
create one right now and you can do so by clicking sign up here on the top right.

01:46.870 --> 01:51.090
In my case I've already got a Google account and I've already hooked it up with firebase.

01:51.370 --> 01:55.660
But again if you've never hooked up with firebase and you are signed into Google there should be a link

01:55.660 --> 01:59.050
up here that basically just says yeah I want to sign up for firebase.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.120
That's it.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.210
So once you sign up for firebase you'll get dumped at the firebase con..

02:08.180 --> 02:12.050
So here's the cons. right here your counsel might look a little bit different.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.310
You might see some more.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.320
Next up you're on the top left.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.210
But basically one way or the other you want to find a button that says Create new project.

02:20.360 --> 02:25.490
And if you just created an account I believe it's going to be like right here on the left hand side.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.900
So all we're going to do is create a new project.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.070
That's the goal here.

02:29.570 --> 02:37.780
So click Create new project and I've already got a project called off that I made when I was first developing

02:37.790 --> 02:39.050
the South location.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.900
You can call it whatever you would like.

02:41.900 --> 02:47.450
I'm going to call my project just authentication just to have something different than off and I will

02:47.450 --> 02:48.370
create my project

02:51.620 --> 02:54.480
this is going to take a little bit of time for everything to get set up.

02:54.680 --> 02:59.660
But after creating the project it will automatically take us to our project dashboard.

02:59.660 --> 03:03.860
So the first thing I would tell you about this project dashboard is that it's set up for a lot of the

03:03.860 --> 03:06.960
different features that are included with firebase.

03:07.040 --> 03:13.370
So we've got working with analytics working with authentication which is what we care about database

03:13.370 --> 03:17.510
data storage hosting Baba whois all that kind of good stuff.

03:17.510 --> 03:23.630
The other thing I want to mention to you about using firebase specifically with re-act native all over

03:23.630 --> 03:25.340
the place in the documentation.

03:25.490 --> 03:31.810
You're going to see stuff that says ad firebase to cheer us up your Android app or your web app.

03:32.150 --> 03:37.490
And of course re-act need a doesn't quite fit into any of these single categories.

03:38.030 --> 03:43.340
We're going to be using our firebase here web app because what this ad firebase your web app can really

03:43.340 --> 03:49.230
be read as is just add firebase to a javascript application and that is what.

03:49.420 --> 03:49.900
Oops.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Not yet not yet.

03:52.010 --> 03:52.970
All right that's fine.

03:52.970 --> 03:54.530
And that's basically what we're really doing here.

03:54.530 --> 03:59.670
We are adding firebase to a javascript application.

03:59.730 --> 04:00.450
All right.

04:00.450 --> 04:05.070
So one last thing we need to do here to get set up for our application on the left hand side we're going

04:05.070 --> 04:12.810
to find that off section and click it and then immediately always get some set up here and we're going

04:12.810 --> 04:14.690
to set up a sign and method.

04:14.940 --> 04:19.650
So I'm going to set up a sign method and these are all the different providers that we can use with

04:19.650 --> 04:20.790
firebase.

04:20.790 --> 04:25.380
Now unfortunately you know you'll see Google Facebook Twitter get hub.

04:25.380 --> 04:29.220
It would be awesome to do oh off with re-act native.

04:29.340 --> 04:38.120
But right now unfortunately firebase does not have great support for using providers with re-act native.

04:38.130 --> 04:45.970
So for us right now we're just going to be making use of email and password as a authentication mechanism.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.120
So a click on an email and password.

04:48.270 --> 04:52.890
And I know this is really small by the way but there Xoom doesn't do the greatest.

04:52.890 --> 04:53.810
Maybe that's better.

04:54.030 --> 04:59.100
Ok so I clicked on email and password and we are going to specifically say yes I want to enable this

04:59.100 --> 05:02.070
please turn on email and password authentication.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.230
So then we'll save.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.130
And that's pretty much it.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.420
We just enabled email and password as an authentication mechanism.

05:11.760 --> 05:16.500
Let's now continue in the next section and get our client set up with firebase
