00:00.920 --> 00:06.690
Our last stop was focused on learning more about the styling and building of basic components for our

00:06.690 --> 00:11.730
next application we're going to focus on something that is required by nearly every single mobile app

00:11.730 --> 00:12.600
out there.

00:12.780 --> 00:19.320
Authentication or the process of signing in and signing out users to your application will be wary of

00:19.350 --> 00:21.880
authentication using the popular data service.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.290
Firebase which we'll use later on for some other interesting apps as well.

00:26.580 --> 00:31.560
So given that this is a new application we are going to want to generate a new re-act native project

00:31.560 --> 00:37.050
as well so that my terminal inside of my you know kind of general project directory here.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.670
So Ive got my albums project right here.

00:39.770 --> 00:44.350
I'm going to generate a new project by using the re-act native CLID.

00:44.490 --> 00:50.690
So if you recall re-act dash native in it and I call this project off.

00:51.570 --> 00:54.740
So this is going to start up our new project and install the Penzeys.

00:54.870 --> 00:56.070
It's going to take a little bit.

00:56.070 --> 01:00.390
So let's talk a little bit more about the app that we're going to build and just kind of let this installation

01:00.390 --> 01:01.910
run.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.920
So let's check out a diagram of what we're going to be making.

01:07.420 --> 01:07.810
All right.

01:07.810 --> 01:08.280
Here we go.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.720
So this is a mockup of the app that we're making.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.990
We're going to very purposefully keep it pretty limited in scope.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.910
So we're just going to be signing a user in and allowing them to sign out.

01:18.290 --> 01:23.200
So when our first app first starts up we're going to be on this Left-Hand kind of state over here.

01:23.960 --> 01:29.540
These are really prompted with a signed form that will ask them for their email and password after they

01:29.540 --> 01:31.620
press the logging button right here.

01:31.850 --> 01:35.340
We'll then consider them to be like signed in or logged in.

01:35.450 --> 01:38.170
At which point in time they'll see the screen on the right hand side.

01:38.450 --> 01:41.280
So again when the users sign then they won't have too much to do.

01:41.270 --> 01:42.650
They're just going to be able to sign out.

01:42.660 --> 01:47.180
We're going to get this the absolute basics of authentication for now.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.970
Now there is one interesting aspect to this flow.

01:50.060 --> 01:53.840
You'll notice that we've only got kind of the sign in screen right here and there's nothing about sign

01:53.840 --> 01:56.140
up right there's no ability to create an account.

01:56.390 --> 02:01.620
So we're going to do to keep the lowest amount of friction for getting users sign a true application.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.620
We're going to just show them log in screen and if they try to sign in with an e-mail address that we've

02:06.620 --> 02:10.940
never seen before we're going to assume that they're trying to create an account and we'll just create

02:10.940 --> 02:11.950
an account for them.

02:11.960 --> 02:19.790
So we are going to have this kind of dual purpose log in and sign up screen all in one right here before

02:19.790 --> 02:20.760
ever starting an app.

02:20.780 --> 02:25.400
I like to always have a good idea of the different components I'll need to create and also figure out

02:25.400 --> 02:27.550
what the biggest challenge is that the app will be.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.060
So let's do that right now.

02:30.430 --> 02:34.530
So for this application I think that we're going to be able to reuse a lot of the components that we've

02:34.530 --> 02:35.390
just made.

02:35.590 --> 02:42.040
So we'll have a better component will have a card with some card sections and then a button to actually

02:42.040 --> 02:43.090
do to log in.

02:43.090 --> 02:47.320
So I'm kind of thinking that perhaps the only component that we might need to make will be this log

02:47.320 --> 02:48.490
and form component.

02:48.730 --> 02:55.210
And the purpose of log in form will be just to hold the sign of fields and the button and all that kind

02:55.210 --> 02:57.740
of good stuff.

02:58.130 --> 03:01.760
As far as the challenges in the south we're definitely to have quite a few.

03:01.790 --> 03:07.210
So we need to figure out how to use firebase to authenticate a user or an application.

03:07.310 --> 03:12.020
That means we're going to sign up for the firebase service and enable authentication and install the

03:12.020 --> 03:14.240
library to our project.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.670
Speaking of firebase especially is a library once we install it we're going to need to figure out how

03:19.670 --> 03:26.330
to integrate it into react so we have firebase did have a reactive integration library called re-act

03:26.330 --> 03:32.170
fire but it's not very well maintained and not really kind of up to date with react in general.

03:32.630 --> 03:35.720
So also our next challenge will be for the log in form itself.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.060
We need to figure out how to handle user input.

03:38.060 --> 03:43.040
So there's going to be like a type of ball field right here that users need to press on and then enter

03:43.040 --> 03:43.730
some input.

03:43.730 --> 03:46.800
So we need to figure out how to handle input.

03:47.540 --> 03:53.110
Also close related to input we need to figure out how to validate whatever data the user enters.

03:53.270 --> 03:58.820
So if the user enters a email right here that does not exist or excuse me if they entered email and

03:58.820 --> 04:04.470
password combination that is incorrect we should give them a nice big error message to display.

04:04.670 --> 04:10.830
Finally to make a usable application we want to give a reasonable amount of feedback to our users.

04:11.090 --> 04:17.750
So in this context we want to make sure that when ever we are attempting to log a user in like so when

04:17.750 --> 04:23.420
they type in the email and password and then click log in we shouldn't show a spinner to let the user

04:23.420 --> 04:27.350
know that we are attempting to verify their email and password so that they know that you know we're

04:27.350 --> 04:29.260
actually doing something.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.290
So definitely a lot of challenges with this app.

04:31.340 --> 04:37.250
You know deceptively it looks like there's not a lot going on here but trust me we're going to cover

04:37.250 --> 04:41.330
a lot of content just to get the sign up form put together.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.110
So let's continue the next section and start working on this application.
