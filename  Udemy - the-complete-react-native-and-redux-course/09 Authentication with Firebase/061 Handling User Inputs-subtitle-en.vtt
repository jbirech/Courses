00:00.670 --> 00:05.940
In the last section we kicked off our log and form component by import import on a couple of different

00:05.940 --> 00:09.000
components from our common directory.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.890
You'll notice here that you know condensing it down to a single line is just fantastic saves us a lot

00:13.890 --> 00:15.290
of space here.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.930
Now there's a couple of different directions that we can go with our blog and forum to get it working

00:18.930 --> 00:21.850
for accepting a email and password.

00:21.900 --> 00:27.160
But I think the best direction is going to be to focus on just getting some text inputs in here.

00:27.180 --> 00:31.590
In each of the card sections and starting to receive an email and a password from the user you know

00:31.590 --> 00:34.560
just give them the ability to type something in.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.300
So that's a great place to start.

00:36.300 --> 00:41.790
But before we do let me say something really quick handling text inputs is a little bit of a pain with

00:41.790 --> 00:44.450
re-act native Cade's a little bit of a pain.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.700
So to figure out how to handle text inputs Here's the methodology we're going to take.

00:49.860 --> 00:54.170
We're first going to implement a text input inside of this log in form.

00:54.180 --> 00:59.440
So we're going to do all the work that's required directly inside this logging form.

00:59.810 --> 01:05.150
After that you know after we figure out how it works we're going to factor out that text input to a

01:05.150 --> 01:07.510
separate component to a reusable component.

01:07.580 --> 01:09.320
OK so that's that's the plan here.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.920
We're going to first figure out how it works and then we're going to refactor it over time.

01:14.360 --> 01:14.710
OK.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.420
So with that disclaimer Let's get started with some text fields.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.500
The Riak native library provides us with a primitive text field and a text field.

01:23.510 --> 01:28.140
I mean just something that can accept text from use or called text input.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.450
So we're going to import that right now from the re-act native library.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.930
So here is our view.

01:33.980 --> 01:39.230
I will also Pullan text input like so the text input.

01:39.240 --> 01:44.700
Again it's a primitive It's a view tag or you know a component that we can place anywhere inside of

01:44.700 --> 01:46.180
our render method.

01:46.230 --> 01:52.890
So we want to have one text input or input for each of our hard sections three hours going to focus

01:52.890 --> 01:54.900
on doing one of the two inputs.

01:55.020 --> 02:02.810
So I'm going to expand out like hard section and inside of it or place a text input like so.

02:03.170 --> 02:03.760
OK.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.400
So here is kind of difficulty.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.300
Number one with text inputs and let me tell you there's more than one difficulty.

02:11.300 --> 02:17.990
Number one is that text inputs by default do not have a set height and width by default they behaved

02:18.020 --> 02:20.230
just like the image tags we saw earlier.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.190
They render with a height in the width of zero and they also have zero styling in general.

02:25.220 --> 02:30.230
So if we just went refreshed our simulator right now we would not see anything pop up on the screen

02:30.740 --> 02:35.540
so it'd just get our text input to be visible like just visible.

02:35.540 --> 02:42.980
We're going to add on a style tag or a style Propp excuse me and we'll give it a hard coded height of

02:42.980 --> 02:45.740
20 and a width of 100.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.050
OK.

02:46.090 --> 02:48.520
So this is just to get the darned thing visible.

02:48.860 --> 02:55.820
So let's flip Bobe and our simulator now and you'll see that our card section the first one now appears

02:55.820 --> 02:57.680
to have a little bit of height to it.

02:57.950 --> 03:02.710
If I click all the way to the left all the way to the left if you click in the middle it won't work.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.380
You have to click all the way to the left.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.220
We can then start to type.

03:06.230 --> 03:07.210
So OK.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.070
It looks like we are able to accept some amount of text here.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.890
So we're definitely going in the right direction.

03:12.890 --> 03:18.410
Let's take a short break and come back and talk a little bit more about exactly how text inputs work

03:18.500 --> 03:19.490
with re-act native
