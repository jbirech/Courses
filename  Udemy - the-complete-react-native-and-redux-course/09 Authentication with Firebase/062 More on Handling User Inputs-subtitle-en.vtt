00:00.910 --> 00:06.660
In the last section we got started with our text input here and we imported Tulsa's style on it and

00:06.660 --> 00:11.080
just verified that yup we can type something in the simulator if we want to.

00:11.100 --> 00:15.150
One thing that's kind of been bugging me here from the last section is we're not using this view tag

00:15.150 --> 00:19.200
anymore on our import for rock native son is going to be a little bit of cleanup.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.510
I'm just going to kill that tag because we're not using it.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.050
OK everything's Miller red on the screen.

00:24.060 --> 00:27.140
Can't stand the red.

00:27.230 --> 00:27.520
All right.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.010
So we need to focus on making sure that we can somehow receive text from the user with this text input

00:33.610 --> 00:34.010
now.

00:34.030 --> 00:34.990
Yes.

00:35.050 --> 00:41.290
Right now we can type into this thing but how do we actually get access to that text inside of this

00:41.290 --> 00:43.660
text input right from inside of our input.

00:43.660 --> 00:46.780
How do we pull some text out of that text input.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.980
That's the goal of what we want to do.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.140
That's the goal of this section.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.880
We're going to figure out how to receive text from that text input.

00:53.290 --> 00:58.250
So I got to tell you right now this is definitely one of the really weird parts of react and react native.

00:58.450 --> 01:01.100
So the plan here how we're going to tackle this.

01:01.210 --> 01:05.260
We're going to toss up a bunch of code on the screen and they're going to talk about exactly how it

01:05.320 --> 01:05.940
works.

01:05.980 --> 01:06.270
OK.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.750
So we're going to do this in kind of reverse order of normal.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.870
We're going to toss the code up on screen and then figure out how it works.

01:13.930 --> 01:17.590
So we're going do a little bit of typing without quite knowing what's going on.

01:17.590 --> 01:23.410
The first thing to do is I'm going to add some state to my component remember state is what we use to

01:23.410 --> 01:28.830
deal with feedback from the user or react to user events in some fashion.

01:28.840 --> 01:35.740
I'm going to initialize my state object to have a single property of text and the single property of

01:35.740 --> 01:41.710
text will start off as an empty string next inside of my text input.

01:41.800 --> 01:46.570
I'm going to add another prop in here and again will I guarantee you we're going to come back and discuss

01:46.570 --> 01:48.250
how this stuff is working.

01:48.250 --> 01:56.910
I'm going out on another project of on change text and then to this product right here we'll pass a

01:56.910 --> 01:59.340
fat arrow function.

01:59.610 --> 02:04.810
It's going to be called we're going to be called with one argument which is going to be text.

02:05.240 --> 02:11.010
And as soon as this thing is called we're going to set our state with that text.

02:11.010 --> 02:15.550
Keep in mind here I'm going to use the condensed 6 syntax for this object right here.

02:15.570 --> 02:19.960
So I have just text but that will get expanded to look like so.

02:20.010 --> 02:26.080
So I'm setting the property text with the text that this function got called with.

02:26.130 --> 02:26.640
All right.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.360
Now one less one less weird thing and then I promise you we're going to talk about what's going on.

02:31.420 --> 02:34.640
I'm going out on a nother prop here of value.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.590
And you said equal to this state DOT text.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.160
OK.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.260
So all right.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.690
Couple of changes three changes in total I added in state.

02:44.170 --> 02:51.640
I added in and on change text callback here and I also added in a prop of value that we passed to the

02:51.640 --> 02:53.110
text input.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.420
So I'm now going to refresh my simulator.

02:55.450 --> 02:59.860
Let's just see hey is anything different dating change here and.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.480
Well ok.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.200
I mean it looks completely identical.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.810
What the heck is different right.

03:05.830 --> 03:09.400
What is different about what we just did it sure feels like something is different but what do we actually

03:09.400 --> 03:09.980
do.

03:10.270 --> 03:16.210
Let's take a quick break and then come back and discuss exactly the purpose of using state with this

03:16.210 --> 03:17.320
text input here.
