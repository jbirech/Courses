00:00.770 --> 00:05.270
In the last section we install dependencies for our new project and spoke about some features of the

00:05.270 --> 00:09.110
app that we're going to built now that our project is all ready to go.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.340
I'm going to start up my code editor inside the auth directory.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.410
And I'm also going to open up my simulator.

00:15.410 --> 00:18.110
Now I've already taken the liberty of starting my simulator up.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.080
You'll see it right here.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.250
It's already running.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.540
I encourage you to pause a video right now.

00:22.550 --> 00:27.670
Remember you can startup your simulator by running the command react.

00:27.980 --> 00:33.740
React dash native run ins or run Android Android.

00:33.800 --> 00:39.920
If you are on Android so let it do its thing and start up the simulator or emulator.

00:39.920 --> 00:40.460
All right.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.280
If you're still here I'm going to assume you have your simulator running.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.670
So let's keep going inside my code editor.

00:46.760 --> 00:51.180
Notice all those same files and folders that we had on the last app that we generated.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.920
So we still have the Android and iOS folders.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.100
We've got the node modules directory.

00:56.150 --> 01:02.090
We've got a bunch of configuration stuff and then we've also got our route file the index does J.S.

01:02.090 --> 01:03.860
file.

01:03.860 --> 01:08.900
Now one thing that you might notice about this default re-act native project is that it doesn't really

01:08.900 --> 01:11.690
give us a lot of project structure.

01:11.750 --> 01:17.030
In other words let's imagine that at some point in time if we are working with a ton of different components

01:17.330 --> 01:22.190
there's not really any clear location on where we should stuff all those components or where we should

01:22.190 --> 01:25.100
really place them inside of our application.

01:25.100 --> 01:31.370
So I'm going to suggest that maybe we should create a new folder to house all the different components

01:31.550 --> 01:34.430
that you and I need to create for this project.

01:34.490 --> 01:40.220
So going to do that right now inside my office directory I'm going to make a new folder called SIRC

01:40.640 --> 01:45.890
and we're going to say that we're going to put all of the custom code that we write for our application

01:46.190 --> 01:48.560
inside the SIRC directory.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.980
The only thing that's going to stay outside will be the index file because re-act native requires there

01:54.980 --> 02:02.040
to be an index dot file in our project directory in order to start up correctly.

02:02.100 --> 02:07.860
Now you will notice when we first generated our project there is a default component that is made for

02:07.860 --> 02:10.000
us and is placed inside this.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.000
J.S. file.

02:11.250 --> 02:18.150
So by default the index dodgiest file imports that app and then attempts to show it on the screen.

02:18.150 --> 02:21.890
So I don't really want to make use of this default app that JSA file.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.060
I'm going to delete it and we're going to make our own but this time we're going to place it inside

02:27.060 --> 02:29.250
of the S or C directory.

02:29.250 --> 02:35.610
So inside the Cercy directory I'm going to make a new file and I'm going to call it app dot J.S. as

02:35.610 --> 02:36.170
well.

02:37.690 --> 02:44.500
Inside if you're going to place some import statements and a new component to generate some content

02:44.500 --> 02:45.660
that we can show on the screen.

02:45.670 --> 02:51.690
So just a very simple little component something to just get us started inside the app.

02:51.740 --> 02:52.510
Jazz file.

02:52.550 --> 02:59.680
I mean first start off by importing react and component from the re-act library.

02:59.860 --> 03:08.230
And I'll also import the view and text tags from re-act native as well.

03:08.230 --> 03:15.820
Then I will create my new app component I'll say class app extends component I'll define my render method

03:15.820 --> 03:21.820
inside of here and inside there I will return a little bit of just boilerplate tags.

03:21.820 --> 03:29.330
So I put a view and inside the view I'll place a text tag and will say that this text tag says something

03:29.330 --> 03:34.380
like an app whatever you want it to say and then don't forget at the bottom of the file.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.930
We need to export this component as well.

03:37.060 --> 03:42.320
So export default app OK.

03:42.410 --> 03:48.660
Last thing we have to do is make sure that we import the correct file into our index dot js file.

03:48.690 --> 03:55.440
So back inside of index dot J.S. Right now this file is assuming that it can import the component from

03:55.500 --> 03:59.710
a file in the same root directory and that's not the case anymore.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.870
We are now placing this app component inside of the SIRC directory.

04:04.170 --> 04:12.710
So I'm going to fix up the path here by saying SIRC slash app like so we should now be able to save

04:12.710 --> 04:15.450
this file and then refresh our simulator.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.410
And we should see that new content appear on the screen.

04:18.410 --> 04:20.790
All right so it is up here at the top left.

04:20.790 --> 04:24.860
We do have a little bit of an overlap issue but it looks like it definitely works.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.340
So let's keep going in the next video.
