00:00.740 --> 00:05.910
In the last section we've decided to add a spinner component to our application that should appear whenever

00:05.910 --> 00:08.550
the user clicks the logon button right here.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.980
Then when the log in request is complete we should restore the button and make the spinner go away.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.540
Because I expect to use a spin or many different locations.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.620
I want to create it as a reusable component.

00:20.670 --> 00:25.860
That's why we're making a separate component here from the spinner So fortunately we don't have to make

00:25.860 --> 00:31.080
the whole light animated spinner like you know the spinny thing from scratch.

00:31.260 --> 00:35.230
The re-act native library includes a default spinner that we can use.

00:35.250 --> 00:40.140
So we're going to use a default spinner and inside this component we're just going to add on some additional

00:40.140 --> 00:45.940
styling on top of it to kind of further configure in-style the spinner itself.

00:45.990 --> 00:56.670
So from the Riak native library we will import that default spinner as activity indicator indiv indicator.

00:56.670 --> 00:57.760
There you go.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.110
OK so we've got our activity indicator indicator.

01:01.110 --> 01:02.380
This is an actual spinner.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.000
If we place on the screen you're going to see this like you know kind of like an old dial thing moving

01:06.000 --> 01:07.360
around.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.440
Next we're going to place that spinner inside of our view here.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.140
So I'm still going to keep the view tag.

01:12.150 --> 01:16.540
I'm going to keep the new tag around so we can position the activity indicator.

01:17.070 --> 01:27.250
So I'll keep the view and expand the tag and then place the activity indicator like so again.

01:27.290 --> 01:31.640
The whole purpose of keeping the attack here is so that we can make this thing or we can position the

01:31.640 --> 01:33.300
spinner nicely inside.

01:33.350 --> 01:38.810
Specifically I want to be able to center the activity indicator or the spear on the screen and we're

01:38.810 --> 01:40.860
going to use the tag to do that.

01:41.090 --> 01:47.450
So to make sure that the activity indicator is always centered on the screen we'll add in a style tag

01:47.610 --> 01:51.890
that's going to put in some positioning properties on top of the view tag.

01:51.890 --> 01:55.490
Also I think I've missed a semi colon here and a place that as well.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.370
So I'll place my style's object on Stiles at the bottom and I'll give a simple property here called

02:03.440 --> 02:06.650
spinner style like so.

02:07.130 --> 02:13.040
So this spinner style will be applied to the view tag and its purpose is to make sure that the spinner

02:13.100 --> 02:14.550
is centered on the screen.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.840
So to make sure that you tag fills up the full width of the screen you want to fill the full width.

02:20.900 --> 02:26.720
I'm going to give it a flex one and then to center the activity indicator itself.

02:27.230 --> 02:33.290
We'll use our justified content of center in a line items of center as well.

02:33.290 --> 02:37.110
Finally we will apply the spinner style to the new tag.

02:37.460 --> 02:46.110
So on The View tag we'll say hey you should get your style from Styles dot spinner style OK.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.380
So this is pretty much all we need right now to at least give us video on the screen and make sure that

02:51.380 --> 02:53.410
it's nicely centered.

02:53.510 --> 02:55.990
There is one less thing that we need to do here.

02:56.030 --> 03:01.520
The activity indicator by default has two possible properties you can sign to it.

03:02.060 --> 03:08.030
We'll actually I should say one one property and that property has two different options to it.

03:08.500 --> 03:14.990
I mean we can pass a Size property to the activity indicator and that indicates whether or not we want

03:14.990 --> 03:17.270
this to be large or small.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.550
So we can either say I want a large spinner something like takes up a decent amount of space on the

03:22.550 --> 03:30.110
screen or I can pass in a small property here in which case we get a much smaller spinner to appear.

03:30.290 --> 03:37.040
So we will assume that we will pass in the size of the spinner as a prop to this component and we're

03:37.040 --> 03:39.870
going to pass it in as a prop called size.

03:39.890 --> 03:45.240
Remember these prop names that I'm pulling out here are all completely arbitrary completely random.

03:45.260 --> 03:52.370
I'm just deciding that I want to pass my component that I'm creating a prop called size.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.010
Now this size prop that I'm passing to the activity indicator However this is a special name here.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.200
This is the component that we did not create.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.580
We did not right.

04:01.580 --> 04:05.920
So it has some number of built in or default props that we can pass it.

04:06.050 --> 04:09.850
One of which is called size.

04:09.890 --> 04:14.570
Now we're going to use a little bit of trick here to assign the size property to the activity indicators.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.900
Let's write out the code for it first and we'll talk about what it does.

04:17.960 --> 04:27.350
And right size or large what this does right here is it says if we pass in a size property when we create

04:27.350 --> 04:29.390
the spinner then use that.

04:29.420 --> 04:34.780
Otherwise if we did not pass in a size property use the string large.

04:34.820 --> 04:40.290
So by default if we do not specify the size for our spinner we're going to get a large one.

04:40.310 --> 04:44.750
Otherwise if we say specifically that we want a small one we will get a small one.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.550
So this is just a little shortcut for handling that logic.

04:49.420 --> 04:49.930
All right.

04:49.930 --> 04:51.920
So I think we're just about done here.

04:51.940 --> 04:56.710
The last thing we have to do is wire this thing up inside of our long form.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.990
Let's take care of that in the next section.
