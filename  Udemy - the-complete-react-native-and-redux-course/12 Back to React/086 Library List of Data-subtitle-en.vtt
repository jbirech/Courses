00:00.870 --> 00:05.820
In the last section we went through the process of designing the different reducers inside our application

00:05.910 --> 00:11.550
and we ended up deciding on having two separate reducers a producer that's going in turn our list of

00:11.550 --> 00:17.160
libraries or so to the user and a selection reducer which is going to keep track of the currently expanded

00:17.190 --> 00:20.800
or kind of selected reduce or library excuse me.

00:21.450 --> 00:25.740
So in this section we're going to work on the design of our library reducer.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.730
So we need to create a new reducer and it should always return a very static list of libraries to show

00:32.730 --> 00:34.050
to our user.

00:34.200 --> 00:40.400
So that's our goal you know flip back over to our reducers index file.

00:40.770 --> 00:45.050
Remember inside of here right now we've got that single dummy reducer.

00:45.060 --> 00:52.200
By convention we usually locate one reduce or in one file so like a one to one mapping just the same

00:52.200 --> 00:54.250
way as we have with our components.

00:54.270 --> 00:59.550
So inside of my reducers directory I will make a new file that is going to house all the code having

00:59.550 --> 01:01.620
to do with our library reducer.

01:01.920 --> 01:08.570
So I will make a new file and the reducers folder and I'm going to call it library reducer.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.360
Yes.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.260
And then inside of here.

01:12.330 --> 01:16.030
Right now I'm just going to put in some boilerplate.

01:16.260 --> 01:20.280
So a very again simple reducer whenever it runs.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.300
Always return an array.

01:23.670 --> 01:26.530
Am I going to flip back over to the indexed on J.S. file.

01:26.530 --> 01:29.600
I'm going to wire it up to the rest of my application here.

01:29.670 --> 01:33.100
So remember the very overriding theme of redux.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.180
Nothing is done automatically for you.

01:35.220 --> 01:35.520
Right.

01:35.530 --> 01:41.640
And like just making a function inside of a file call library reduce or does not do anything we have

01:41.640 --> 01:43.370
to very explicitly wired up.

01:43.390 --> 01:44.100
OK.

01:44.760 --> 01:57.360
So inside of this index Jasc file import library reducer from library reducer and then instead of using

01:57.360 --> 02:03.180
a very simple dummy function right here we will say library reducer.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.600
OK.

02:04.890 --> 02:12.050
So just a quick reminder and we're going to just really really drive this home at this point next point

02:12.060 --> 02:17.280
home to you in the coming sections here because it's one of the what I think is the most confusing points

02:17.280 --> 02:21.660
of redux and maybe because maybe because I'm going to make such a big deal about it maybe it won't be

02:21.660 --> 02:23.450
quite as confusing but you know whatever.

02:23.450 --> 02:25.670
Let's just go through it.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.380
We have said many times that reducers produce our application state right.

02:31.380 --> 02:36.410
A producer runs it returns a value and boom that is our application state.

02:36.420 --> 02:41.250
Now we might have many different reducers inside of our application and we need to somehow get them

02:41.280 --> 02:42.960
all to work together properly.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.400
And so that's why we introduced this combined reducers call right.

02:46.470 --> 02:52.080
I said this is the thing that makes multiple reducers work together nicely.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.910
So the thing that I really want to point out to you here and again I will just harp on this repeatedly.

02:56.910 --> 03:04.230
We now have one douceur called the library reducer inside of my combine reducers call.

03:04.230 --> 03:11.560
I assigned this reducer to a key called libraries of libraries right here like supersession that likes

03:11.580 --> 03:17.910
just stare at that word libraries because I assigned the library reducer to this library's key right

03:17.910 --> 03:18.720
now.

03:19.050 --> 03:25.230
If I ever conc a log my state objects like you know Konst a log store that get state which we had done

03:25.230 --> 03:27.020
several times previously.

03:27.240 --> 03:35.090
I would expect the response to be or the result the console log to the libraries is an empty array.

03:35.460 --> 03:41.040
OK so our library reducer right now always always returns an empty array.

03:41.270 --> 03:48.660
And because I assigned that reducer to a key of libraries my application state will now be an object

03:48.960 --> 03:54.020
that has the key libraries with a value of whatever got returned from that reducers.

03:54.030 --> 03:59.940
So again like the whole point here is because I signed library reducer two libraries key my application

03:59.940 --> 04:02.370
state has a key of libraries.

04:02.370 --> 04:02.970
That's it.

04:02.970 --> 04:03.330
That's it.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.580
I know a lot of talking just to convey that point.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.040
But again this is something that I have found can be very very confusing and once we start making use

04:11.040 --> 04:16.650
of our state objects and practice again I will come back and harp on this some more because I'm sure

04:16.650 --> 04:21.160
you love being I'm sure you love being lectured endlessly right.

04:21.180 --> 04:22.690
All right now I'm just kidding.

04:23.120 --> 04:23.420
OK.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.520
So here's our library producer again right now.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.910
Very simple very straightforward not really doing anything.

04:28.050 --> 04:33.750
But we wanted to return our list of libraries like the list of all the data showed to our user and we

04:33.750 --> 04:40.470
agreed or maybe I just dictated one or the other that the data structure for this list of libraries

04:40.530 --> 04:46.860
should be an array of objects where each object represents one single library.

04:46.860 --> 04:52.260
So what I want to do now is I want to say instead of returning just a completely empty array I want

04:52.260 --> 04:57.480
to return a list of objects that is going to represent all the different libraries to show to the user.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.000
OK that's it.

04:59.980 --> 05:06.010
So rather than kind of you know inside this reduce or typing out all these different libraries to show

05:06.010 --> 05:09.540
to the user just to keep this reducer nice and clean.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.020
I'm going to make a separate file to How's this list of libraries because I expect there's going to

05:14.020 --> 05:15.190
be many of them.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.520
I want to show so inside of my reducers directory.

05:18.520 --> 05:24.710
I'm going to make a new file called library list dot Jaison.

05:24.730 --> 05:26.510
Take special note of the file extension.

05:26.510 --> 05:27.580
Here it is Jason.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.480
It is not.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.600
Yes.

05:30.160 --> 05:37.020
So this Jason fall right here is going to be a dumb day dummy data file like just going to have data.

05:37.060 --> 05:41.460
It is a Jaison file which means I should place Jason data in here.

05:41.470 --> 05:43.150
It is not a javascript file.

05:43.150 --> 05:51.850
I cannot locate javascript code inside of here so I can place an array in here and then an object inside

05:51.850 --> 05:52.700
this object.

05:52.720 --> 05:57.260
I will put all the properties I need for my my library.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.040
So again keep in mind this is just one data.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.630
It is not javascript so I do not have to use an export statement here at all.

06:04.780 --> 06:05.770
Just have to put Jason.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.150
That's it.

06:08.280 --> 06:14.140
OK now I have already created a big list of libraries that I am going to copy paste into this file right

06:14.140 --> 06:19.810
here so I'm going to flip over to this code editor over here where I just had this data file already

06:19.810 --> 06:25.030
located and paste it all and I'm doing this intentionally very quickly because I don't want to have

06:25.030 --> 06:28.670
to go through all this typing of all this these different libraries in here.

06:28.710 --> 06:33.220
So in the next section the next section that you're going to see inside this course you're going to

06:33.220 --> 06:37.540
have some amount it's going to be basically like a text section and it's going to have the contents

06:37.540 --> 06:43.130
of this file right here so you can just go ahead copy paste it and paste it into this library.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.280
JS on file.

06:45.280 --> 06:50.980
One thing I want to point out here is that because it is a JS ON FILE all values are all string values

06:51.110 --> 06:57.760
text values have to be wrapped with double quotes so absolutely feel free to change the value of any

06:57.760 --> 07:01.730
of these libraries right if you want to add some to the end of your list.

07:01.900 --> 07:05.180
Or you want to use completely different titles or different descriptions.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.320
Absolutely feel free to modify this as much as you want.

07:08.350 --> 07:12.700
Just make sure that any modifications you make both the key and the value have to be wrapped with double

07:12.700 --> 07:13.760
quotes.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.420
So unless you are going to do.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.150
Again.

07:17.230 --> 07:17.680
Well you know what.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.160
Tell you what.

07:18.190 --> 07:19.850
How about let's take a quick pause.

07:19.930 --> 07:25.060
I'll let you copy paste this file ope over and then we will actually make use of it inside this reducer.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.100
So again take a quick break.

07:27.130 --> 07:30.900
Cut Paste the stuff in here and we will return and make use of it.
