00:00.870 --> 00:05.460
Let's take a bit of a break from redux for a moment and focus a bit more on the rest of our application

00:05.880 --> 00:10.620
now based on the mockups that we've looked at previously we certainly know that we're going to need

00:10.650 --> 00:14.020
a header component and a list composed of sorts right.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.550
Some like something to render the list of all the different topics that we're going to have.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.450
Now we've already got a head or component built from our previous projects.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.800
So I think we should take the same approach as last time.

00:24.870 --> 00:29.300
We're going to copy and paste over all of the common components that we had used.

00:29.300 --> 00:35.580
OK so again there is some fancier ways of sharing code across projects but just for the sake of this

00:35.580 --> 00:39.930
application you know kind of in the context of this tutorial we're going to take the easy way out and

00:39.930 --> 00:42.660
just kind of copy paste some components over.

00:43.390 --> 00:49.080
So first thing we'll do is inside of our Textbook Project we'll make a new folder to hold all of our

00:49.080 --> 00:49.890
components.

00:49.890 --> 00:56.400
So inside my source directory I'm going to make a component's folder and inside of there I will again

00:56.400 --> 00:58.380
make my common folder.

00:58.500 --> 01:04.590
So I've got component's common and just to be clear the idea behind the name common is like this.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.110
These components are common to many different parts of the application.

01:08.140 --> 01:10.000
That's the idea behind it.

01:10.680 --> 01:15.730
OK so now we're going to copy and paste our components over inside my console.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.240
I'm just going to go ahead and pull up my project directory

01:20.880 --> 01:29.940
and pull up a second window soon to do this from the command line.

01:29.960 --> 01:35.120
There we go OK not getting the second one that's fine.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.790
We'll do this the hard way.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.290
So I get to go into my art project which was the last one that we worked on.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.870
My source folder components folder common folder.

01:45.090 --> 01:49.020
And here we go here's all the different components that we made that we've been carrying through from

01:49.020 --> 01:50.380
project to project.

01:50.430 --> 01:56.100
I'm going to just copy them all and then I'll go back to my text project which is the one that we're

01:56.100 --> 01:57.400
working on right now.

01:57.720 --> 02:05.010
I'll go into my source directory components directory common directory and boom paste them all right

02:05.010 --> 02:06.230
in there.

02:06.270 --> 02:11.310
So again however you want to do this and you get a copy from the command line you can copy from the

02:11.310 --> 02:13.230
file explorer whatever way you want.

02:13.230 --> 02:17.580
Basically we just want this set of components inside of our common directory.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.980
Now again if you feel like you're not super happy with the state of these compounds right here if you

02:22.980 --> 02:27.940
feel like you know maybe my spinner isn't quite put together correctly or it's not working.

02:28.110 --> 02:33.840
I encourage you to go check out the official course repo and just copy the common components directly

02:33.840 --> 02:34.590
from there.

02:34.590 --> 02:37.470
And again you can find the Course repot on get hub.

02:37.530 --> 02:41.730
There is a link to it in a much earlier section within this course so feel free to check it out if you

02:41.730 --> 02:43.830
would like.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.720
All right so flipping back or in my code editor now I've got my common directory in here is all the

02:48.720 --> 02:50.400
common components inside of it.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.850
So just to kind of get something on the screen just to get something working.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.840
Let's make immediate use of the head or component.

02:57.060 --> 03:02.370
So we will import the header component into our app and place a header on the screen and just verify

03:02.370 --> 03:05.470
Yup like you know it's has shown up in everything it's good to go.

03:06.210 --> 03:14.580
So inside of my app component I will import header from components slash common.

03:14.610 --> 03:20.550
And again we are making use of that convention where if we just import a directory will automatically

03:20.550 --> 03:27.990
pull in the index file if it contains one then inside of our component here side of the app I will place

03:27.990 --> 03:37.730
my header tag and I'll give it a header text Propp just text act or whatever you would like if you like.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.420
You know any other name in here.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.060
Feel free.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.050
Feel free to go for it.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.860
Some customization.

03:43.860 --> 03:47.440
Now the one thing I want to point out here is that we have the provider tag.

03:47.580 --> 03:52.830
Remember that the provider tag is what serves as glue between the redux side of our application and

03:52.830 --> 03:54.480
the re-act side.

03:54.480 --> 04:01.250
The one little tricky thing about the provider is that it can only have one single child component.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.640
Now that child can have as many subcomponents as it would like.

04:04.740 --> 04:08.360
But right now we have two children that we're passing to the provider.

04:08.370 --> 04:13.230
So if I rendered this in the simulator right now I would end up with a big fat error message something

04:13.230 --> 04:16.840
about the provider only being allowed to have one child.

04:16.980 --> 04:23.580
So I can fix that by wrapping my head or component with the view tag.

04:24.790 --> 04:25.500
Like so.

04:25.780 --> 04:29.890
So now if I have multiple children you know other children they want to toss in here and I certainly

04:29.890 --> 04:31.150
will you know certainly.

04:31.270 --> 04:35.620
I can just place them right in here you know wherever else or whatever other components I would like

04:35.620 --> 04:36.560
to have.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.100
So that would be a nice setup.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.660
All right let's check out the simulator.

04:41.660 --> 04:41.920
Yes.

04:41.930 --> 04:43.300
Simulators running.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.350
Pretty sure my terminal is running with the re-act packager.

04:46.390 --> 04:46.870
Yup.

04:47.080 --> 04:54.400
Let's refresh and just verify that I've got a header on the screen and there we go there's my text.

04:54.850 --> 04:55.490
Fantastic.

04:55.510 --> 05:02.560
So we pulled over all of our common components which means we can reuse just a ton of code going forward

05:02.560 --> 05:05.360
from this course to projects that you work on yourself.

05:05.530 --> 05:10.480
I highly encourage you continue carrying over these common components right here and just develop them

05:10.480 --> 05:11.290
over time.

05:11.560 --> 05:16.300
And after you know maybe you make a toy application or two you'll end up with a set of components that

05:16.300 --> 05:23.920
you know really well and you can use to put together future applications in a really compact timeframe.

05:24.610 --> 05:25.010
OK.

05:25.090 --> 05:30.700
Let's continue in the next section and start focusing on putting together a list of libraries for application
