In the last section we threw in an action creator to delete an employee.

00:04.890 --> 00:09.180
The only thing we have to do with it is make sure that we call it with the idea of the employee that

00:09.180 --> 00:10.810
we want to delete.

00:10.830 --> 00:16.380
We reach out to our firebase data store groud the very particular employee out of all of our Jason data

00:16.470 --> 00:17.500
and remove it.

00:17.640 --> 00:23.160
And after that over to the employee list the last thing you have to do is hook this action creator up

00:23.160 --> 00:25.490
to our employee component.

00:25.560 --> 00:32.220
So back inside of employee at it I will first scroll all the way to the top find my import statement

00:32.220 --> 00:37.710
from my action creators and I will import employee delete.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.140
Then I need to make sure that I bind this action creator to the component itself and scroll all the

00:43.140 --> 00:46.600
way down to the bottom Heres my connect statement.

00:46.770 --> 00:52.140
I will add an employee delete as an action creator to be bound to the component.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.390
So now the very last thing we have to do.

00:54.480 --> 01:00.390
Very last thing whenever a user on the Confirm message or on a confirmed component whenever they press

01:00.390 --> 01:06.440
that yes button whenever they say yes I wanted to leave this user that is going to call on except callback.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.280
So inside of Onix set we need to make sure that we call the employee delete action creator.

01:12.600 --> 01:19.380
It's going to scroll up to on except we will call this stop prop's employee delete.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.600
And remember we have to call the thing with the ID of the employee that we want to delete.

01:25.620 --> 01:33.530
So to get access to that Id We will look out the employee object on this on this component's props.

01:33.540 --> 01:42.030
So say your ID is coming from this dot props dot employee.

01:42.030 --> 01:47.420
Now we can pass this you ID into employee delete and that should be about it.

01:47.450 --> 01:49.570
Do make sure that you pass in as an object.

01:49.650 --> 01:55.530
So I should have you know curly braces you ID and make sure that over interaction creators well are

01:55.530 --> 02:00.950
on on delete action creator receives that as an object ID.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.970
All right I think we're all ready for some testing in here.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.560
Now I took the liberty of adding another employee that we could just test around with as well.

02:10.620 --> 02:11.920
And thats John.

02:12.210 --> 02:16.480
So we just hired John but John is not going be working here for very long.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.520
Here's John I'm going to fire John.

02:20.010 --> 02:23.830
And tonight we're left with just Jane.

02:23.850 --> 02:25.010
Perfect.

02:25.050 --> 02:29.060
So I want to also test really quickly dismissing the motile as well.

02:29.070 --> 02:33.150
So it open Jane back up you know fire the employee of a song say no.

02:33.200 --> 02:39.120
Jenkins stick around and TA-DA the motile just goes back down to the bottom with a nice little animation

02:39.120 --> 02:39.850
as well.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.010
So that's pretty much it.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.980
That's our whole application.

02:42.990 --> 02:47.340
We've covered every type of resource or excuse me every type of operation we could take on this employee

02:47.340 --> 02:53.760
resource so we can create them edit them delete them and of course just read them as well so just show

02:53.760 --> 02:54.790
them up on the screen.

02:55.020 --> 03:00.090
I think the most interesting part of this application was without a doubt making that decision about

03:00.090 --> 03:04.810
how to split out the employee form between employee create an employee at it.

03:04.870 --> 03:10.920
So I want to reiterate there that you know we decided to rip out just the input or excuse me the the

03:10.920 --> 03:12.430
fields themselves.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.090
So we can show it in both the Create an edit version that form.

03:16.200 --> 03:21.210
I think this was ultimately a very good decision because if we ever come back with more custom behavior

03:21.540 --> 03:28.320
for either the create or the added side of the equation we can keep on adding in more and more implementation

03:28.590 --> 03:33.080
without really having to worry about disrupting anything that's going on with the you know create form

03:33.090 --> 03:35.940
or the form or whichever one we're not working on.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.280
The one thing I will say is that this all makes this assumption that the employee form or I should say

03:41.280 --> 03:44.120
the fields that we're showing on here are never going to change.

03:44.130 --> 03:50.070
So there definitely could be a situation in which we say well you know whenever I create an employee

03:50.070 --> 03:52.510
their name is never really going to change.

03:52.530 --> 03:56.710
So I should never let a user change the name of an employee.

03:56.910 --> 04:02.430
That would definitely use case for splitting off two separate versions of the employee form or just

04:02.430 --> 04:06.280
pulling all those fields into each of the edit and create components.

04:06.450 --> 04:11.840
So only when the fields start to change when I start to really you know worry about not be able to make

04:11.920 --> 04:13.680
reuse of this employee form component.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.090
Anyways I thought that was a really interesting part of this application and I hope you've enjoyed putting

04:18.090 --> 04:19.560
this out together.
