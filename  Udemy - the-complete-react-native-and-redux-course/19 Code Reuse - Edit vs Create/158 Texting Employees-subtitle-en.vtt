00:00.770 --> 00:03.600
Our form is looking great here for editing employees.

00:03.660 --> 00:08.190
I mean the next thing they're going to work on is giving us our selves the ability to text the user

00:08.370 --> 00:09.460
their schedule.

00:09.750 --> 00:14.820
Now I'm going to tell you right now this might be a little bit underwhelming like texting people.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.710
Gee that sounds like something that's really hard right.

00:16.710 --> 00:20.180
Well this is one of the awesome things about Riak native.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.770
It is incredibly easy to text people or at least to initiate the texting process.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.430
We're not going to like automatically send off a text message to the Target employee.

00:30.570 --> 00:36.450
We're going to kick our users over to their native text messaging client on the device and we'll let

00:36.450 --> 00:39.030
them send the final message.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.950
So it's going to be perhaps a little bit underwhelming but sometimes in programming that's actually

00:43.950 --> 00:46.360
a very good thing to have happen.

00:46.410 --> 00:50.190
So let's check out the package that's going to help us out inside my browser.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.520
I've navigated over to NPM J.S. dot com.

00:53.550 --> 00:57.890
This is where we can find documentation on all the different packages on NPM.

00:58.170 --> 01:03.120
I'm going to look up a specific package called re-act native communications

01:06.680 --> 01:08.300
and I'll navigate right to it.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.680
So here is reac need of communications and then scroll down a little bit.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.960
The fantastic thing about this package is that it works both for iOS and Android so we can use this

01:17.960 --> 01:24.260
to not only text people but also to initiate phone calls e-mails.

01:24.280 --> 01:29.610
So here is all the stuff about e-mails and then here's what we really care about texting as well.

01:29.860 --> 01:31.080
And this is pretty much it.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.020
That's all we've got to do.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.300
We're going to call text passen the phone number that we want to text something to.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.980
And the body of the text message.

01:37.990 --> 01:41.760
So definitely something we don't need to overcomplicate here.

01:41.860 --> 01:50.860
Let's first install this as an NPM package and my command line will do NPM install save re-act native

01:51.520 --> 01:56.390
communications and I'm sure that's going to finish installing really quickly here.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.530
So while that's going I'm back in my employee edit form inside of here I want to add a new button to

02:02.530 --> 02:04.190
do our texting.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.260
So here's my render method.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.560
I've got the employee form here's the card section for with my button.

02:11.650 --> 02:15.600
I am a little bit you know I don't know if I can make a separate card section for the thing.

02:15.610 --> 02:16.630
I think I will.

02:16.930 --> 02:22.190
Let's make a new card section for this second button that we're going to add.

02:22.330 --> 02:28.720
I'm going to put a little bit of spacing between these just to make it all easier to read.

02:29.020 --> 02:36.080
So add on and on press will say on text press about that

02:40.100 --> 02:47.740
and then the text for the button lot in text schedule like so.

02:48.060 --> 02:53.390
So now whenever someone touches this button we're going to call the helper method on text press.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.690
Let's add that in right now on text.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.280
Prus

03:01.100 --> 03:03.780
and then back up at the top I will import.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.650
Let's first make sure that the installation was successful.

03:06.660 --> 03:07.790
Yep it is.

03:08.030 --> 03:09.260
So I will import

03:11.750 --> 03:20.580
communications from re-act native communications and then here comes the kind of disgustingly easy part.

03:20.790 --> 03:26.000
I know I should try to make this make this a lot harder than it than it is.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.120
We'll take our phone and our shift from our prop's object and we'll call it communications.

03:35.130 --> 03:41.100
Text the phone number and I'll do it interpretated string here because all customize the message just

03:41.100 --> 03:42.180
a little bit.

03:42.180 --> 03:48.630
Your upcoming shift is on shift.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.700
So I did use string interpolation here your template strings so make sure you get those back ticks instead

03:53.700 --> 03:55.050
of regular quotes there.

03:55.230 --> 03:58.490
Also I think that this message right here.

03:58.650 --> 04:03.580
If Yeslam is complaining to do not sweat it this is not not something to worry about.

04:03.630 --> 04:07.380
It's just saying hey it also has this export that you could grab.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.190
Totally optional.

04:08.190 --> 04:13.430
I really like having communications don't text as opposed to just not just text by itself.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.490
Anyways let's test this out in our emulator.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.170
So refresh

04:22.270 --> 04:23.180
let's sign in

04:29.380 --> 04:38.200
all go over to Jane and I'll text Jane the schedule and whenever I press this it looks like not quite

04:38.200 --> 04:39.820
getting any response here.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.370
So let's figure out what's going wrong in the next section
