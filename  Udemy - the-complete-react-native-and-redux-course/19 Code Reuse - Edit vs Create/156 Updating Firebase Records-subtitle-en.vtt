WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:06.220
Our employee edit form is really coming along whenever a user clicks on the Save Changes button.

00:06.380 --> 00:11.930
We're going to run on button press and we have now verified that when we cancel log name phone and shift

00:12.260 --> 00:15.550
we get the updated values out of that form inducer.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.140
So all we have do now is replace this console log with an action creator that will actually save our

00:21.380 --> 00:23.130
new data after firebase.

00:23.180 --> 00:23.910
So let's do that now.

00:23.930 --> 00:29.150
We'll start off by writing the action creator all imported into this file we'll call it from on button

00:29.150 --> 00:32.870
press and then we'll test it all out inside the simulator.

00:32.870 --> 00:38.250
So Step 1 is going to be to open up my employee actions file.

00:38.420 --> 00:45.470
Now we've covered previously on how to create new records and firebase believer or not saving or I should

00:45.470 --> 00:48.180
say updating records is really just as simple.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.940
So we're going to form up a ref to the database and then instead of calling this push method right here

00:53.990 --> 01:00.410
which usually creates a new record we'll use what's called the set property and what it does is it updates

01:00.410 --> 01:01.100
information.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.880
So set is for updating.

01:03.050 --> 01:05.000
So see how that works in practice.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.700
At the bottom of my file I'm going to create a new action creator Randy Khalis.

01:09.770 --> 01:17.820
Employees say I don't expect employees it to be called with a name or phone.

01:18.130 --> 01:20.830
A shift and an ID.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.020
So that last last property of their idea this is the real key right here.

01:26.030 --> 01:32.660
Remember that in the case of saving or really you know updating an employee we are updating an existing

01:32.660 --> 01:33.150
record.

01:33.170 --> 01:37.850
So we have to be very explicit until firebase that we are attempting to you know like a this record

01:37.850 --> 01:41.330
over here the one with this idea this is the one that we are trying to update.

01:41.420 --> 01:46.670
So whenever we call this action creator we need to make sure that we specify the employee that we are

01:46.670 --> 01:47.910
trying to save.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.130
Or I should say update if I flip over to my firebase console just to be 100 percent clear you'll see

01:55.130 --> 02:02.900
that I have on users the first idea that's in here is my user ID that user has an employee's collection.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.100
And this is that you I.D. the idea of that very particular employee right here.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.720
So that's where that is coming from.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.200
All right.

02:11.200 --> 02:16.930
So as far as creating the ref to the database it's going to look very similar to the others.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.540
We're first going to need to get access to the current user

02:22.720 --> 02:29.760
like so I am pretty darn sure that this is going to be an asynchronous action creator again.

02:29.770 --> 02:33.900
So again I'm going to return a function because I know that I do.

02:33.930 --> 02:38.180
I'm not going to have anything to return right away from this from this action creator right.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.420
I don't know anything just yet.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.340
Then inside of here we'll form up our raft to our database.

02:44.340 --> 02:47.170
So firebase start database.

02:47.190 --> 02:49.990
RATH we're going to place our ticks.

02:50.030 --> 02:50.930
So we'll do slash.

02:50.930 --> 02:58.840
Users will designate the current users I.D. employees.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.480
And now here's the interesting part.

03:00.570 --> 03:04.740
We need to specify the exact record that we are trying to update.

03:04.770 --> 03:11.910
So usually before we were just saying like hey yeah go find that employees bucket and you know actually

03:11.940 --> 03:16.940
appear as a better example go find that employees bucket and push on the new record in their right just

03:16.940 --> 03:19.410
through a new record on top this time around.

03:19.410 --> 03:22.710
We are trying to update a very specific record.

03:22.830 --> 03:26.870
So in the ref we are pointing to a very specific record.

03:27.020 --> 03:35.040
I am pointing to the one with this very particular I.D. and once it's found I want to set some new number

03:35.040 --> 03:36.490
of properties on it.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.440
So we're going to set on there the name the phone in the shift.

03:41.850 --> 03:47.760
Finally right now I want to just do a count of log of saved.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.980
So after everything is done all the accounts log of saved and we'll call it get checks are in reality

03:52.980 --> 03:56.540
we're going to want to navigate back to the employee list screen.

03:56.550 --> 03:57.900
I think that would be a good idea.

03:58.020 --> 04:02.200
But right now we'll just kick to use or just a season we'll just do a console log.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.590
All right I think we're ready to do a up.

04:04.590 --> 04:09.250
Almost forgot one last thing we need to make sure that we actually call this action creator from somewhere.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.620
So I'm going to import it over into employee at it.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.370
So I'm going to flip over to employ it at the top.

04:16.380 --> 04:23.400
I've already got an import statement from my employee update action creator of Poland employees save

04:23.400 --> 04:24.030
as well.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.070
And then I'll hook it up to my component down inside the connector paper.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.950
I'll do a new line just to make things look nice.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.760
Here's employee save.

04:35.930 --> 04:43.410
And then finally inside of the button the button handler that is I can call this stop prop's dot employee

04:43.710 --> 04:44.530
save.

04:44.820 --> 04:49.500
And of course I need to pass and the modified name phone shift.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.570
And don't forget.

04:50.580 --> 04:51.930
Here's the really important one.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.880
The ID of the record that we are trying to update.

04:54.990 --> 05:00.070
So as you I.D. to pass and stopped Propst employee you I.D..

05:00.420 --> 05:03.830
So this last little bit here and that that's the nasty part.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.120
Where did this employee come from.

05:06.120 --> 05:12.180
Remember when ever we come to employee at it the only way you can navigate this thing is by clicking

05:12.180 --> 05:15.340
or tapping pressing on an employee.

05:15.420 --> 05:23.280
And when you do that we have our event handler inside of our list item and the list item transitions

05:23.280 --> 05:27.860
us over to employee had it passing in that employee as a prop.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.090
So that is where this does start.

05:30.090 --> 05:35.130
Props don't employ you ideas coming from it is because whenever we come to this view we are specifying

05:35.130 --> 05:39.330
the very particular employee that we are trying to work on.

05:39.330 --> 05:39.630
All right.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.040
I think we are ready for a test here.

05:41.050 --> 05:47.690
It's going to save this all do a refresh.

05:47.830 --> 05:48.730
I will log in

05:53.500 --> 05:54.270
and here's.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.310
I deleted all my other employees.

05:56.330 --> 06:00.980
I want to have just one in here so that I can see the actual record that is going to get updated.

06:00.980 --> 06:08.220
So here's Jane all by her lonesome on tap and again all of Jane's attributes are pre-filled in the form.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.510
So Jane five five Monday is actually what I expect.

06:11.510 --> 06:12.830
Let's update her phone number.

06:12.850 --> 06:19.640
So she's got a new phone number and I expect her you know let's be really mean let's really to make

06:19.640 --> 06:23.150
scene work on Saturday to read from Jane.

06:23.670 --> 06:27.770
It's now going to click on see if changes are going to expect that this is going to make her request

06:27.830 --> 06:30.400
off to firebase update this record.

06:30.560 --> 06:35.510
And I should see a council log that just says something like Hey safety record looks good.

06:35.510 --> 06:40.520
So I click save changes we get the yellow flash over here which means some data has been updated.

06:40.550 --> 06:40.940
You'll see it.

06:40.940 --> 06:45.950
Now I've got the phone number of 4 4 4 4 4 and my shift is now on Saturday.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.230
Perfect.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.720
Let's see I want to do is verify that we got the concert log.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.150
Yup.

06:50.210 --> 06:50.720
Here it is.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.440
It says saved exactly what I expected.

06:53.510 --> 06:54.300
So it's perfect.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.780
We're working really well right now.

06:55.820 --> 07:00.500
I think the last thing that we need to do is make sure that we navigate the user back over to the employee

07:00.500 --> 07:01.460
list.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.610
Normally I would say let's do it in the next section.

07:03.620 --> 07:07.130
But in this case well you know it lets us handle this event along section.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.690
Let's take care of the next section.

07:08.780 --> 07:13.880
So scene a second we're going to navigate our users back over to the employee list after they successfully

07:13.880 --> 07:15.450
save the changes.
