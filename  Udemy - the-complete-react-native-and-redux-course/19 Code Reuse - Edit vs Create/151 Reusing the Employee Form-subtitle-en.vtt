00:00.880 --> 00:05.520
In the last section we got our employee list working so we can see all the different employees we've

00:05.520 --> 00:07.160
created for our app.

00:07.320 --> 00:13.260
We should of course be able to handle or excuse me be able to tap on any given user and navigate to

00:13.260 --> 00:15.960
that screen so we can see more details about them.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.520
So let's work on the next.

00:17.820 --> 00:20.110
We've handled navigation several times in a row now.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.690
So I bet you've got a pretty good idea of what to expect.

00:23.700 --> 00:30.320
We want to call our actions helper from the router whenever a user taps on an individual row.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.920
Now of course we've done something like this before.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.220
Back when we're building lists previously.

00:35.220 --> 00:46.950
So in my list item component I'm going to import the touchable without feedback and the view tags and

00:46.950 --> 00:55.980
then inside of my render method I'll add on the touchable without feedback a view tag and then I'm going

00:55.980 --> 00:57.450
to close both those off.

00:57.450 --> 01:08.300
So there's the card section close off the view and close off the touchable without feedback looks good.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.660
And now we need to add in on press handler to touchable without feedback.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.370
So whenever we touch tap this thing we're going to do some work right.

01:16.380 --> 01:21.920
We got a callback in here somewhere so I'll pass this in on press handler.

01:22.380 --> 01:31.080
I'm not going to call it about on road press I'll blind it to this next level to find the method on

01:31.080 --> 01:31.860
the class.

01:31.860 --> 01:38.060
So on road press and then presumably in here we're going to want to do our actual navigation.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.510
So we haven't imported actions yet but we will in just a second.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.320
So I'm going to show.

01:43.550 --> 01:47.780
Let's see it let's double check the amount that key was for that form that we're using.

01:47.820 --> 01:53.040
So I can open up the router whenever we are on the employee list.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.610
We are on a key of an employee list.

01:55.710 --> 02:00.130
And then when we want to go over to that form we're going to go to employee create.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.950
So we're going to go to actions dot employee create.

02:06.450 --> 02:15.260
Lastly I need to imports the actions object from our favorite unnamed library out there.

02:15.310 --> 02:18.290
Re-act native router flux.

02:18.510 --> 02:19.730
Ah God.

02:19.750 --> 02:20.400
The first time.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.490
Fantastic.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.750
OK let's do a little bit of testing and you know to see you know I'm kind of driving towards a point

02:27.750 --> 02:32.370
here this is going to be a little bit more challenging a little bit more interesting than than what

02:32.440 --> 02:37.850
you might think it was mean of the last big challenges we have to confront in this application.

02:37.980 --> 02:38.220
OK.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.450
So I just signed in here's my list of employees.

02:40.560 --> 02:47.910
Now I'm going to tap on an employee and I go to the employee create form when we get here however the

02:47.910 --> 02:51.740
form doesn't seem to have any details related to the employee I just tapped on.

02:51.750 --> 02:56.320
Remember we're like we're using this form as kind of a show.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.460
And at it.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.620
So we don't really specifically have like a show route or a show screen words going to show an employee.

03:02.670 --> 03:08.010
We've only got the concept of like editing our employee and that's just because that's how I designed

03:08.010 --> 03:08.780
the app right.

03:08.790 --> 03:16.080
Like I want to show the edit form here and then like a save changes a fire and a text button down the

03:16.080 --> 03:16.680
bottom as well.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.020
That was the idea here.

03:18.510 --> 03:25.420
So I click on the employee and you know we get the form but there's no details related to that employee.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.210
And of course there's no details.

03:27.210 --> 03:28.550
Why would there be right.

03:28.560 --> 03:34.290
We've got our employee form reduce our debt is 100 percent in control this form right here and we have

03:34.290 --> 03:39.180
done nothing whatsoever to tell that reduce or hey please make use of this employee.

03:39.180 --> 03:43.610
You know I just tapped on the employee make sure that the form reflects that employees attributes the

03:43.610 --> 03:46.430
right kind of stuff we have done nothing around that.

03:46.980 --> 03:52.380
All we did was tell the navigator to show this form so we can have any expectation that you know anything

03:52.380 --> 03:54.830
is just going to magically happen here for us.

03:54.840 --> 04:00.780
So what we really want to have happen is we want to somehow instruct the employee form that whenever

04:00.780 --> 04:07.800
it loads up and when I say employee form I'm talking about employee create of course want to tell employees

04:07.800 --> 04:09.700
create that whenever it loads up.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.660
It should be showing a very particular employee.

04:12.690 --> 04:19.420
So we kind of want to like bootstrap the form so to speak we want to pre-load the data that it shows.

04:19.560 --> 04:24.630
Now we could use an action creator to set a you know like selected employee or something like that.

04:24.630 --> 04:29.820
Maybe we could select a particular employee and say hey the former do search should always show either

04:29.820 --> 04:36.080
the stuff in the form or the selected employee that does just getting like a little bit weird.

04:36.180 --> 04:42.270
So let's go with the route of kind of like what I want to say hijack but no bootstrap.

04:42.270 --> 04:42.690
There we go.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.150
We're trying to bootstrap this form.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.100
I want to kind of inject my employee into it

04:50.380 --> 04:56.920
so inside of my actions doc employee create method right here I need to somehow communicate to the form

04:57.100 --> 04:58.690
which employee I want to show.

04:58.690 --> 04:59.810
Right that's like the whole idea.

04:59.820 --> 05:07.450
I want to somehow tell it hey for me need to be showing this very particular employee right to do so.

05:07.450 --> 05:14.080
We are going to pass some props over to the employee create form with this navigation help right here

05:14.710 --> 05:18.200
so we can pass any object we want in here.

05:18.610 --> 05:24.910
I'm going to pass an object with the key of employee and the value of this dot dot employee.

05:24.910 --> 05:32.830
Now whenever this navigation method is called the Employee create form will be rendered and it will

05:32.830 --> 05:36.900
be given an additional Propp of employee.

05:37.330 --> 05:42.850
We are in the list item right now and each list item is called with one employee which is provided as

05:42.870 --> 05:44.240
this Propst employee.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.760
So that's where this value is coming from right here.

05:47.830 --> 05:49.210
So let's test this out a little bit.

05:49.210 --> 05:55.240
I want to flip over to the employee create for now so I can go to employee create and inside the render

05:55.240 --> 05:55.960
method.

05:56.110 --> 06:04.190
I'm just going to console log this doc Propst not employed like so.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.730
So let's do a quick refresh.

06:06.770 --> 06:13.970
I'll pull up my a log in Hoopes

06:17.960 --> 06:21.230
And now if I just go ahead and hit add up I'm on top right.

06:21.270 --> 06:26.810
You see undefined because we went to the form and we did not pass any like configuration directly to

06:26.810 --> 06:31.640
the form only when we navigate to this form by tapping on an item.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.660
Our repassing this extra prop to it.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.390
It's not going to click on Samantha to go to the form.

06:36.470 --> 06:40.670
And then this time around I get the very particular employee in here as well.

06:40.850 --> 06:45.870
So now we are loading up our form and we know which employee we want to show in it and you know we know

06:45.870 --> 06:50.620
which employee we want to kind of pre-filled these different fields with.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.740
So let's figure out how to do that how to do that.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.430
Pre-filing in the next section
