00:01.110 --> 00:08.140
We're now able to save changes made in our edit form so we changed everything over to Jane.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.060
We update the phone number update the shift save changes and we saw those changes reflected over and

00:13.060 --> 00:13.940
firebase.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.750
So that's what we have to do is flip open our action creator and Williger.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.660
We want to say that after an employee has been successfully saved we're going to want to navigate them

00:24.660 --> 00:28.500
back over to our employee list screen.

00:28.830 --> 00:32.870
So we're going to first verify that we've imported our actions object up at the top.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.670
Sure have.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.320
That means that we can come on back down.

00:38.090 --> 00:44.620
I'm going to replace the Cancellara statement here with actions dot employee list.

00:44.750 --> 00:50.180
And again I want to make sure that when I navigate back to the employee list I'm not adding onto the

00:50.180 --> 00:50.660
stack here.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.570
I'm not going forward of you i'm back of you.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.770
So I go back I'm going to reset my whole stack.

00:56.840 --> 01:04.220
We did this once already with that type reset so we can as pass an option of type reset

01:06.880 --> 01:09.380
and then if I load my list up again

01:16.920 --> 01:19.910
let's add it Jane again because Jane is all I have.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.360
So let's make it work on Friday now at least a little bit nicer.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.310
I'll save changes and boom we're back over here now.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.270
Sounds good right.

01:28.290 --> 01:33.930
Well hey wait a minute wait a minute that's a big mistake.

01:33.930 --> 01:40.080
After we edited Jane I clicked on the Add button and Jane's attributes were already in the form.

01:40.110 --> 01:43.240
So remember our form reducer.

01:43.290 --> 01:48.420
It holds all of the forms state and that form state is being used in multiple places now both in the

01:48.450 --> 01:50.910
edit form and the create form.

01:50.940 --> 01:56.880
So the instant that I am done modifying an employee I need to make sure that I clear out all of these

01:56.880 --> 02:02.100
saved attributes on the form and what that really means is I need to reset the properties on my form

02:02.100 --> 02:04.090
reducer.

02:04.110 --> 02:07.130
We handle this once already with the Create case.

02:07.140 --> 02:12.060
So if I scroll up a little bit here is employee create we we're dispatching an action that said employee

02:12.060 --> 02:14.440
create and that let me know hey.

02:14.610 --> 02:15.360
OK.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.430
Time to reset all the attributes inside the form.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.760
So let's do the same thing here as well.

02:20.790 --> 02:25.840
We will dispatch an action of employees save success.

02:25.890 --> 02:32.710
Once we get that action inside of the reducer we can we can reset all the forms attributes.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.480
So first we will make sure that we get dispatch in here.

02:35.490 --> 02:41.040
So here's our dispatch method and then we will dispatch an action after we have successfully saved this

02:41.040 --> 02:41.990
employee.

02:42.120 --> 02:47.290
So we will call that employee save success.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.350
Of course we don't have this type available yet.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.690
So I'm going to scroll up to the top.

02:51.890 --> 02:55.200
We will add it as another type employee.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.980
Saves access.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.580
We have to add it as a type to our types file as well.

03:03.580 --> 03:07.830
So export Konst employees saves excess

03:12.250 --> 03:17.170
and I think you know where this is going we're going to flip over to our douceur the former douceur

03:17.170 --> 03:25.660
that is all grab employees save success and then once I see this

03:28.840 --> 03:36.260
gloire save success I will again return my initial state which is going to reset all the attributes

03:36.260 --> 03:39.350
inside the form just of what we want it.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.810
Now one thing I want to point out to you just a little reminder

03:44.570 --> 03:50.900
if I flip back on my form right now and let's update this again to Thursday excuse me that's when they

03:50.900 --> 03:56.510
create most going to go on Jane again I mean said Jane to Thursday I want to save changes.

03:56.690 --> 04:00.240
No I cook Jane again you'll notice that Jane is now on Thursday.

04:00.380 --> 04:07.460
Just to be really clear what's going on there inside of our employees fetch action creator remember

04:07.460 --> 04:14.150
how we had that on value thing and I'd said any time we update or save a record we're going to automatically

04:14.150 --> 04:15.790
get this event across.

04:15.830 --> 04:19.070
Dispatch grabbed the new employees and load them up.

04:19.220 --> 04:24.110
So that is why we're seeing that instant update for us when we just do the save.

04:24.110 --> 04:24.350
All right.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.490
When we just saved this record right here let's go to Wednesday and I click save changes.

04:28.730 --> 04:35.390
Just changing the record by default doesn't actually change it in our state like nothing actually happens.

04:35.390 --> 04:41.870
Just because I happen to set it here is specifically because we set up a watcher on the value of this

04:41.870 --> 04:44.030
location on this list of employees right here.

04:44.090 --> 04:48.850
It is only because of this right here that we get that updated model back from firebase.

04:48.890 --> 04:53.540
So there's a lot of actions that are being dispatched automatically inside of our application.

04:53.540 --> 04:58.380
We just have to kind of describe what we want to have happen and remarks and firebase take it from there.

05:00.190 --> 05:07.510
I think that we are all set with editing employees now which means we get to move on to our next topic.

05:07.510 --> 05:09.680
We need to be able to delete employees.

05:09.820 --> 05:13.820
We also need to be able to text employees their updated schedule.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.910
So let's start on both of those topics and the next section
