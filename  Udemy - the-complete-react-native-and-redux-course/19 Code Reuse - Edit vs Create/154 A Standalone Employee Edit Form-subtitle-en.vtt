00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.910
We're now ready to make an edit employee form that's going to look awfully similar to employ create

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.350
for them.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.400
But the big difference is that this one will need to do something completely different when the user

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.990
clicks the button at the bottom.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
And so that's where it gives us or creating a separate form is going to give us the ability to more

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.190
easily customize the the function of the button here at the bottom.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.080
All right so let's get to it.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.170
Microphone's directory.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.330
I'm going to make a new file called employee edit.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.840
Yes this is going to be where our form is going to sit for editing an existing employee.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.600
We'll toss in our boiler plate.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.610
I'm going to expect that we'll need the card card section and Button components in here and pull those

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.130
in common and then we'll make our class.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.560
So employee at it extends component we'll do our render method I'm going to leave it empty for just

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.570
a second.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.720
Let's do export default employee added at the bottom and now we'll do our render method.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.590
So inside of here it's going look very similar to our existing employee create form.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.730
Allow the top level of card will have a card section

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.510
that's going to have a button inside of it.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.530
And then this button can say like save changes.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.960
Just make sure that it's really clear that hey you are editing an existing employee you can click this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.350
if you want to save any of the changes that you're making.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.560
Now we need to also make sure that the employee form exists in here and we need to pass down any appropriate

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.810
values down into it.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.460
So at the top of this file I will import my employee form

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.640
from an employee form.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.480
I'm also going to need to make sure that I connect this thing to redux

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.280
like so and then the reason just barely clear the reason that we are doing the connector right here

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.740
is to make sure that we can call an action creator to this employee that we're trying to mess around

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.690
with a little bit.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.140
So let's hook up connect at the bottom.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.480
I don't have the actual creator put together just yet.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.990
So I'm not going to pass anything into connect just a star.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.870
I will put inside my employee form.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
However there we go and I think you might have to do a typo.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.670
Employee from employee form.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.300
Thank goodness for E.S. lint huh.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.550
That's a it's an annoying little one.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.380
So now our employee for our employee it is excuse me is at a place where he can be displayed on the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.980
screen.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.070
So here's where things start to get more interesting.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.610
We need to now customize this version of the form to work for editing and employee.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.930
That means two things.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.810
First we need to make sure that this form always gets navigated to with an employee in mind like the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.740
one they were trying to operate on and load that employee's attributes into the form reducer.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.230
So that's going to be the part where we initialize the valleys in our form.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.710
Second we're going to need to add another action creator to specifically update an employee as opposed

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.540
to our existing one which just creates a new employee.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.270
So let's take care of these two challenges in the next section
