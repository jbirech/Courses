WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:04.730
In the last section we got started with some boilerplate set up for application.

00:04.740 --> 00:10.130
We created our app component and then we referenced that inside of both of our index files.

00:10.140 --> 00:15.690
I then started my simulator and as I kind of expected Yep we've got a big error message expected to

00:15.690 --> 00:17.520
reduce or to be a function.

00:17.580 --> 00:23.200
So we created our redux store right here but we never actually provided it a default reducer.

00:23.220 --> 00:29.010
So remember inside of all redux applications you must provide at least one default reducer or just something

00:29.010 --> 00:33.450
so it can run and say OK here's my starting state for my application.

00:33.450 --> 00:38.480
So let's go ahead and create that default reducer and then wrap up all of our setup.

00:38.520 --> 00:43.920
So all of our reducers that we create for application will be placed inside of a folder inside of the

00:43.970 --> 00:45.470
SIRC directory.

00:45.480 --> 00:53.670
So inside the S or C directory I'm going to make another new folder called reducers and inside of there

00:53.760 --> 00:55.490
we'll create index.

00:55.570 --> 00:56.800
Yes.

00:57.060 --> 01:01.530
And then this will be where we kind of remember wired together all of a reducers with that combined

01:01.530 --> 01:02.810
reducers call.

01:03.180 --> 01:13.560
So at the top we will import combine reducers from redux then we will export default combine reducers

01:14.310 --> 01:16.520
and right now we do not have a producer.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.780
But again it is required that we have at least one in our application some going to make a dummy reduce

01:21.930 --> 01:25.210
right now just just a dummy reducer just to get the ball rolling.

01:25.530 --> 01:29.070
So I'm going to come up with some just you know imagine name for a douceur.

01:29.070 --> 01:31.980
I don't know let's call it a banana.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.420
And by default it will always return an array.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.100
I will then import that reducer back into my app file.

01:40.230 --> 01:50.320
So at the top I will import reducers from reducers and then we'll pass those reducers to the create

01:50.320 --> 01:52.340
store called.

01:52.750 --> 01:57.820
So now we've got one default reducer wired up to our application and we should at least be able to get

01:57.820 --> 01:59.140
past this error message

02:01.840 --> 02:03.870
and see what else we got.

02:03.970 --> 02:04.390
OK.

02:04.450 --> 02:04.910
Very good.

02:04.910 --> 02:11.920
So now I've got that very classy Hello thingamajig on the top left there very classy I know.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.430
So we going to replace the you know don't worry we'll replace on just a second.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.270
There's just one more piece of setup that we need to do.

02:17.740 --> 02:24.880
Of course because we're using firebase for authentication and this app again we need to set up our default

02:24.910 --> 02:26.260
firebase configuration.

02:26.260 --> 02:30.950
And we also need to make a new firebase project over on the firebase console.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.740
So we'll do this in two steps.

02:33.760 --> 02:40.130
The first we're going to do is install the firebase javascript library so at the command line inside

02:40.120 --> 02:47.120
of my project directory will NPM install dash dash save firebase.

02:48.130 --> 02:48.890
Well that goes.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.570
I flip over to my browser.

02:51.080 --> 02:59.080
I'm going to open up my firebase console which I ever so helpfully just seem to have open right here.

02:59.170 --> 03:04.230
You always want to go pop it open yourself and I'm going to make a new project for myself.

03:04.270 --> 03:09.540
So I logged in and out the console and it created a new project.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.550
And I think I'll call this one.

03:11.620 --> 03:17.470
You can call it employees you can call it manager or whatever you want to call it call it just manager

03:18.930 --> 03:22.060
and I'll create the project.

03:22.060 --> 03:23.810
So we need to do two things right here.

03:23.830 --> 03:30.070
We need to make sure that we enable authentication for app and make sure that we say hey email and password

03:30.070 --> 03:32.630
sign is a valid way to get started here.

03:32.860 --> 03:39.280
And the other thing we need to do is copy paste that default set up the project linking stuff all the

03:39.280 --> 03:42.220
code and all that kind of good stuff.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.100
So let's get start with the authentication first.

03:44.170 --> 03:49.700
On the left hand side will find the auth section and we'll set up our sign method.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.390
And again you know we've gone through this before.

03:51.430 --> 03:57.550
You have to specifically say yes I want to enable email and password authentication inside my application

03:58.960 --> 04:08.500
so we'll click on email password enable it save call that's you know pretty much it.

04:08.650 --> 04:14.680
And then on the top right again we'll hit Webbs set up here is all the default information to get started

04:14.680 --> 04:16.680
with firebase insider application.

04:19.330 --> 04:22.820
So I'm going to just copy this big block right here.

04:22.990 --> 04:24.590
I'm not going to get the script tags.

04:24.610 --> 04:30.820
I do not want the script tags I just want the config and the initialized outcall it's all copy it and

04:30.820 --> 04:33.030
then flip back over to my code editor.

04:33.070 --> 04:40.030
Now in the past we created a separate file to house our firebase setup where you place this code to

04:40.030 --> 04:41.610
a large degree a large extent.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.060
It's really up to you.

04:43.180 --> 04:47.170
This time we're going to do things just a little bit differently just for the sake of doing it differently

04:47.170 --> 04:51.670
just to show you hey you can do it this way too if you want to create a separate file that's totally

04:51.670 --> 04:52.840
fine.

04:52.870 --> 05:01.500
But this time around I can say that inside of my apps components will mount I'm going to place all that

05:01.500 --> 05:06.860
initialization code song and do my copy.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.710
By default we get a VAR here.

05:08.910 --> 05:12.170
Of course we want to prefer a concert instead.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.550
And then I also get a lot of complaining about single quotes first double quotes Elisha's go ahead and

05:17.550 --> 05:19.600
fix that up real quick.

05:19.650 --> 05:25.530
And finally we need to make sure that we import the firebase library so that at the top I will import

05:25.830 --> 05:31.960
firebase from firebase and of course you know we just install this at the command line two seconds ago.

05:32.010 --> 05:35.360
Looks like that's all done and stalling so we should be good to go.

05:35.850 --> 05:40.320
So this time around rather than creating a separate file to our firebase config.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.690
I just said you know what I do there's nothing special about firebase here firebase is tightly coupled

05:45.690 --> 05:48.630
to my application as soon as my app is about to boot up.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.800
I want to make sure that the firebase config gets loaded up as well.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.560
So I don't have a separate file you can really toss the stuff wherever you want.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.060
Just make sure that it only runs one time.

05:58.140 --> 06:02.310
Otherwise you can see a error message pop up on the console complaining that you know you're trying

06:02.310 --> 06:05.450
to initialize to firebase applications.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.930
The one thing that I want to point out to you just to make sure we avoid any early errors here do double

06:09.930 --> 06:12.210
check the spelling on component will mount here.

06:12.360 --> 06:17.910
A very common typo I make personally and I actually just made it two seconds ago as a capital I I do

06:17.910 --> 06:21.660
that all the time just you know just all those things anyways.

06:21.740 --> 06:25.530
You know we're very well familiar now with the lifecycle method component will mount.

06:25.590 --> 06:26.960
So I think everything is good.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.470
Let's do a quick refresh.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.030
Make sure we don't get the error message

06:32.760 --> 06:36.410
because we are now importing firebase into our project.

06:36.420 --> 06:41.460
It's going to take our bundlers just a little bit more time to reload in the simulator.

06:41.460 --> 06:47.820
Any time you import a library in to react needed it has to basically pull that thing until the bundle

06:47.820 --> 06:50.260
and so it takes a little bit more time to refresh.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.760
Anyways it looks like our refresh is successful here.

06:52.770 --> 06:57.430
So I think we're all ready to go with our next application.

06:57.430 --> 07:01.360
Let's let's get started in the next one and start working on authentication.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.490
So I'll see in just a second
