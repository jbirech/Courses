00:01.080 --> 00:04.560
We've now done a whole bunch of discussion about the out there we're going to build you know talked

00:04.560 --> 00:07.950
about challenges around it and I don't think we can put off any longer.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.230
I think it's really time to start working on this application.

00:11.260 --> 00:16.890
So unless I actually did start up the installation of our new app so my installation is complete here

00:17.670 --> 00:22.950
I'm going to change into my project directory and I'm calling the app manager.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.830
So I'm changing into the Manager Project file folder.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.190
I just started my code editor.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.920
Our goal in this section is to get through a whole bunch of set up.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.860
OK so we've kind of got a real big stack of set up to do.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.290
We have to install re-act we have to install redux.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.300
We have to hook up those index files.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.950
We have to bring over our default components.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.470
Definitely a little bit of setup here.

00:48.510 --> 00:53.940
I know that the server can get a little bit tedious but you know there's a lot of just having mastery

00:53.940 --> 00:56.380
over that default setup I think is very valuable.

00:56.430 --> 01:00.690
And so even though this is like the fourth time that we're going through the set up I really think it

01:00.690 --> 01:05.830
is a valuable exercise to just figure out how this stuff is all put together from scratch.

01:06.390 --> 01:09.640
Okay so then mind let's get to it.

01:10.050 --> 01:14.050
I don't really necessarily have any set order of you know what the best way to go about this is I think

01:14.050 --> 01:20.370
we're just going to do this on a you know whatever's whatever is easiest to get it started sort of way.

01:20.370 --> 01:25.530
So I think first we'll install some dependencies then we'll set up our boiler plate and then we'll bring

01:25.530 --> 01:27.720
over some default components.

01:27.720 --> 01:33.110
So the first thing we're going to do is install the redux and re-act redux libraries.

01:33.150 --> 01:34.550
So I'm back at the command line.

01:34.920 --> 01:41.990
I'll run and PM install dash dash save re-act redux and redux.

01:42.030 --> 01:46.880
So remember the re-act redux library is specifically the bindings between react and redux.

01:46.890 --> 01:50.860
That's why we're installing that and of course redux is just redux.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.030
So we don't really need to watch the progress bar here.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.670
We can let it do its thing and flip back over to our codebase.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.130
So next I think we should set up our route component remember the root component is we're going to create

02:02.130 --> 02:03.600
our redux store.

02:03.600 --> 02:09.180
We're going to place that provider tag and they're going to make sure that the two index files point

02:09.240 --> 02:11.520
out that root component.

02:11.590 --> 02:16.590
So inside of my project directory or make a new folder that's going to house all the code for our project

02:17.800 --> 02:24.990
and I can call just SIRC and then side if you're going to make my root component which I'm going to

02:24.990 --> 02:29.050
call Apgar J.S. OK.

02:29.060 --> 02:39.440
So Years of us will get started by importing react and component because we are going to create a component

02:39.440 --> 02:44.060
in here and I am going to make it a class based component for reasons that we'll talk about in a little

02:44.060 --> 02:53.130
bit will import the provider tag from re-act redux.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.510
We'll import that create store method from redux.

02:59.510 --> 03:09.200
And you know what let's import the view and text tags from re-act native as well.

03:09.370 --> 03:13.230
You can also tell that I have not yet said it might yes Slint configuration.

03:13.230 --> 03:15.930
You know I'm going to do that here between the next break.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.250
So right now I'm going to go just without.

03:18.360 --> 03:18.810
Lint.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.460
No big deal.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.480
Next we'll create our root component.

03:22.480 --> 03:33.220
So class app extends component will place our render method inside of your and by default we will return

03:34.360 --> 03:40.700
our provider tag and inside of they're going to place a single view

03:44.510 --> 03:45.350
with my textbook

03:48.950 --> 03:50.710
and I'm going to say hello right now.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.790
Now of course I'm probably gonna be running this on iOS.

03:52.810 --> 03:58.420
So as we've seen we're getting a little bit of a overlay on the top nav bar or the top like default

03:58.420 --> 03:59.740
connection bar on iOS.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.880
No big deal.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.600
We're going to replace this thing really quickly but I just want to have something on the screen just

04:04.600 --> 04:07.040
to make sure that you know something's actually working.

04:07.660 --> 04:15.730
So finally at the bottom you export default app now last up in here we need to make sure that we give

04:15.730 --> 04:19.430
the provider tag an instance of a redux store.

04:19.480 --> 04:25.180
So remember that provider tag is what connects to all those different connect tags that we scatter about

04:25.180 --> 04:30.730
our application and the provider tag make sure that all those connect tags can get access to the store

04:31.030 --> 04:34.870
grab our redux state and then pass it off to individual components.

04:35.230 --> 04:44.320
So inside the provider tag will pass it a store with create store like so and then we're going to I

04:44.320 --> 04:46.680
think that this component is probably in a pretty good place right now.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.160
So we'll go ahead and we're wired up to our two index files at the top level.

04:51.490 --> 04:57.280
So inside of my index Android J us let's go ahead and you know we can probably clear out just about

04:57.280 --> 04:58.680
everything in here.

04:59.080 --> 05:06.760
I'll take out the top import and take out all of the other imports re-act native and just leave behind

05:06.760 --> 05:11.280
app registry because we do know that we need that app registry component.

05:11.290 --> 05:12.610
Now here comes the real fun part.

05:12.610 --> 05:18.340
We get to delete just about everything in here except for that app registry registry component tag at

05:18.340 --> 05:20.110
the bottom.

05:20.440 --> 05:29.940
So we will import app from source app and install instead of returning this little manager component.

05:29.950 --> 05:33.540
You know the default line will return our new component.

05:33.550 --> 05:36.030
The one that we just created the app component.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.240
So let's say that I think that the index Android js file now looks pretty darn good.

05:42.550 --> 05:47.040
So I'm going to take all of this and I copy it and I'll pull it over to the index.

05:47.050 --> 05:49.420
Iowa SJS file as well and save it.

05:49.560 --> 05:49.890
OK.

05:49.930 --> 05:50.550
So this is good.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.400
Good start.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.100
We've now got something Nashville to run in both the Android and iOS simulators.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.720
So I think that's enough set up for this section.

05:58.930 --> 06:01.460
Let's take a quick break.

06:02.050 --> 06:08.650
During the break you know one last thing I want to do is going to start up my simulator so run re-act

06:08.680 --> 06:14.770
native run iOS and this is going to take a little minute or two to warm up so I can take a quick break

06:14.800 --> 06:19.550
while this warms up and we'll come back and just verify that our project actually runs on the simulator

06:19.630 --> 06:21.680
so I'll see him in just a second.
