00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.790
In the last section we finished the download of Android studio.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.170
So if I open up my downloads folder I should now see and I know the sex is very small right now.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.640
But bear with me I'm on the Windows machine.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.570
This one is not my Windows machine is not really set up for recording video as well as my Mac is.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.110
Anyways back on topic.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.070
This is our Android studio right here.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.370
The installation file just started up the installation.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.800
And this is in installation as in take a very long time to finish.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.160
So we're going to start it up right now.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.450
Install a couple of things and then probably take a 15 minute break to be honest and then come on back

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.440
and work at the Android studio.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.470
So we'll get the launcher.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.060
Here we go.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.430
Android set up next we get prompt with three options here the studio SDK and virtual device.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.910
And we want all three of these.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
So we will leave them all checked go into the next.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.620
It's a license agreement if you want to read it certainly feel free to do so.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.370
I agree.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.220
This is very critical very critical down here on the second link.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.270
We've got a link to the SDK.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.640
All right.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.070
So link to the SDK.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.610
I want you to take note of this.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.520
The second term inside of your I guess third.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.230
So I've got C users.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.340
And then your user name for your particular machine is very relevant later on.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.020
So for me my user on the machine I'm currently on I am logged in as computer because you know this is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.560
what I called my log in yours might be like Matt Jane whatever your logon name is.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.230
Just keep that in mind.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.370
So I'm not going to change any links in here.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.320
And I highly encourage you to not change them either.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.890
We'll go next.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.990
You can change the name if you would like and leave the same.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.800
And it finally will start out the insulation.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.200
So this right here is the part that is probably going to take a very long time.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.550
Trust me this progress right bar right here is quite deceptive.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.060
This will probably end up taking a bit longer than we think.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.960
So all this runs we are going to do a little bit.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.340
Or just another piece of installation.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.060
Might start menu.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.980
I'm going to open the start menu and then just type in command and this is going to open up the command

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.240
prompt.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.480
I'm going to right click this and run it as administrator.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.070
So please make sure that you do launch this as an administrator.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
And so here I am at my command prompt at this point in time.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.480
We've already installed both node and Python.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.590
So just to test out the installation I will type node dash Daschle and I see here a version 6.6.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.670
So you want to make sure that you correctly see some number print up here.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.050
If you see something that says unrecognized command Well something is definitely off with the node installation

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.970
and we'll need to do a little bit of troubleshooting the next thing we're going to do is install the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.010
re-act native command line tools the rack may have command line tools have exactly two purposes.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.390
First off it generates a new project which is which is what we're really concerned about right now in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.750
its second purpose is to test our projects inside of the Android simulator.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:16.820
We can install the re-act native command line tools by running an install DSG react native CLID.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.480
So this will take just a second to install it's a rather small package and there we go.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.050
We are.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.740
We are now going to use the re-act native CLID generate our first project.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.970
So by default chances are your command line is opening you up in a Windows system 32.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.860
It's not really a fantastic place obviously for placing a re-activated project.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
So I'm going to change to another drive for myself.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.540
Basically you can take yourself to wherever you have your workspace right.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.540
Any any projects you want to place you might be in my documents or wherever it might be.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.260
In my case I've already got a folder called re-act native and so inside of this folder I'm going to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.790
place my new re-activated project that we're going to generate right now.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.760
So once I'm inside a place where I can store my re-act native application I will use the re-act need

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.730
of Selye that we just installed by writing re-act dashed native init and then albums.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.010
So the first part here is a reference to the command line tools that we just installed.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.240
The first argument to that is in that which is us telling it hey please initialiser create a new project

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.070
and then a third term here.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.510
And the second argument is albums.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.860
So this is telling we actually know that we want to initialize a new project called albums.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.880
So hit enter and it will do its own little thing.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.330
Now installation of a new re-active project can take a little bit of time.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.530
Like Definitely I have to do a little bit of time.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.620
So while this is running let's go back over and check out our Android installation.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.820
So I'm still only at 16 percent.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.160
So I think that this would be a fantastic time to go ahead and take a break and when we come back we

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.100
will have the Android SDK completely installed and we will also have our re-act native Project installed

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.690
as well.
