WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:06.240
In the last section we generated our first re-act native project at the command line using the re-act

00:06.240 --> 00:09.910
native CLID tools at the end of that installation process.

00:09.930 --> 00:11.890
You should have seen some instructions like this.

00:11.910 --> 00:16.430
In other words how to run our app on iOS and how to run it on Android.

00:16.440 --> 00:21.790
Now let me be very clear here that the Riak need a team as being almost sadistic.

00:21.870 --> 00:27.240
I would say to Yazzie almost sadistic my making it sound like this is as easy as it as it is to get

00:27.240 --> 00:28.090
started with the android.

00:28.090 --> 00:33.870
No there is certainly without a doubt a lot more installation has to go on outside of just running a

00:33.870 --> 00:35.220
simple little command here.

00:35.220 --> 00:40.910
So in this section we're going to get at some that additional set up that kind of gets glossed over.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.970
All right so let's go ahead and get started.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.270
The first thing I'm going to do is open up the Android studio.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.250
So we just finished installing that in the next section or last section excuse me.

00:50.760 --> 00:58.690
I'm going to go ahead and pop open and then once it's open I'm going to open an existing Android studio

00:58.700 --> 00:59.410
project.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.140
So believe it or not when we created our re-act native project and the last section that gave us a starting

01:06.170 --> 01:07.270
Android project.

01:07.310 --> 01:13.790
So I'm going to open up an existing project and I'm going to navigate to the folder where I placed that

01:13.790 --> 01:14.840
project.

01:14.840 --> 01:22.520
So for me I placed it on my drive inside of the folder called Riak native that generated a project called

01:22.580 --> 01:26.880
albums and inside of there is a folder called Android.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.900
And this is our Android project right here.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.560
So I'm going go ahead and open it up

01:35.130 --> 01:39.710
and this is going to take just a moment to pop open.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.050
All right there we go.

01:42.570 --> 01:47.990
So when we first opened this up I get a nice big error message here.

01:48.030 --> 01:51.840
You might get a little bit of a different message you might see something that says like I don't know

01:52.130 --> 01:56.200
pay compiling gradiently or something like that down at the bottom.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.760
So if you see that message that is totally fine just let it do its thing.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.550
After a couple of seconds like 20 or 30 you'll see a tab pop up on the bottom.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.160
So says messages.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.450
So click on messages and you should see the message I see right here.

02:10.740 --> 02:16.560
Now I know that the text is a little bit smaller here but what it says is cause fail to find target

02:16.560 --> 02:18.960
with mastering Android 23.

02:19.260 --> 02:25.140
And then beneath that is a nice little link that says Install missing platforms and sync project this

02:25.230 --> 02:26.960
little button right here at this link.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.090
Oh you have no idea.

02:28.140 --> 02:33.170
No idea how much pain this thing is saving us from.

02:33.210 --> 02:35.670
It is saving us from a lot of hassle and a lot of trouble.

02:35.670 --> 02:37.690
So we're going to click this link right here.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.240
And thank goodness.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.040
Thank goodness.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.900
Android studio is going to automatically install download and install a little bit of software for us.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.720
So we're going to click accept on the license agreement.

02:48.720 --> 02:54.540
Next we'll download the SDK.

02:54.540 --> 03:01.480
It will unzip it for us and go through the installation.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.350
Now I certainly could puzzle video here but you know again it only takes a moment to finish up.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.890
So all done there a click Finish.

03:08.020 --> 03:13.990
And now again I get another error message pop up right away saying hey I've failed to find build tools

03:14.110 --> 03:15.750
revision 23.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.350
Again we will click on the very helpful link right here.

03:18.370 --> 03:25.190
Install build tools 23 and sync project and boom are good to go again.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.520
Give would you would.

03:26.550 --> 03:29.550
Oh man you won't believe how much trouble that does save for us.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.500
That just saved us a lot of trouble.

03:31.710 --> 03:35.370
By the way if you get a great old plug in pop up we are going to hit.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.940
Don't remind me again to this project and.

03:38.010 --> 03:38.550
OK.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.180
We're good to go.

03:41.070 --> 03:41.330
OK.

03:41.340 --> 03:43.990
So we still have a little bit of work to do here.

03:44.100 --> 03:49.890
What we just installed were some tools to set up an android emulator something something that can run

03:49.890 --> 03:55.080
our re-act native application on the desktop that we can debug against on the fly.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.770
So we still have a little bit of setup to do though.

03:57.870 --> 04:03.090
The next thing you want to do is create an android emulator that we can actually use for a debugging

04:03.090 --> 04:04.440
process.

04:04.440 --> 04:12.810
So at the very top I don't click on Tools Android and then HDD manager once they click on that we get

04:12.810 --> 04:16.060
a nice big pop up something about your virtual devices.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.920
So a virtual device is an android emulator.

04:18.930 --> 04:24.020
It has a window that lets us run the Android operating system inside of Windows.

04:24.270 --> 04:29.190
So we will create a virtual device by default.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.250
I have Nexus 5 selected.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.260
If you see another default selection that's totally fine.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.610
Just make sure that you get a screen size right around 5 inches.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.960
So the nexus 5 is 4.9 5.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.350
That's good enough for me.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.000
I'll click next.

04:43.340 --> 04:46.300
And then here is the next little troublesome bit.

04:46.310 --> 04:53.570
I guess you could say by default it tries to create a emulator with version 24 of Android.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.950
Right now re-act native is making use of re-act native version 23.

04:57.950 --> 05:04.430
So instead of going to select marshmallow download and go through the download process again

05:09.090 --> 05:12.610
so just like the others it's going to take a moment to get started.

05:12.890 --> 05:19.560
We'll go through the download the unzipping and installation.

05:19.700 --> 05:20.870
You know I had considered.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.420
I knew that there were some pauses here for downloading and unzipping and I'm kicking myself because

05:26.420 --> 05:29.140
I really wanted to like put together some jokes.

05:29.180 --> 05:34.500
You know I could tell you while the installation was going but I just completely forgot it.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.070
Maybe next time we'll do we'll do some funny jokes anyways.

05:38.350 --> 05:39.390
All right let's get finished.

05:39.400 --> 05:47.810
Download is all finished and now we can select that API level 23 then click next.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.050
This is some information about the device we're about to build.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.890
We don't have to configure anything else here.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.050
I'll just click next.

05:55.110 --> 05:59.390
Or in this case finish excuse me.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.970
And then finally I can find Nexus 5.

06:02.970 --> 06:04.350
This is now my emulator.

06:04.350 --> 06:07.750
This is my virtual device that I can launch on my desktop.

06:07.750 --> 06:12.440
So on the far right hand side is a play button underneath actions or click it.

06:12.510 --> 06:15.960
And this is going to start up our Android emulator.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.750
So I get spinner and wow.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.360
Yeah it really looks like an actual phone.

06:21.810 --> 06:26.280
So this is going to take a little bit of time to boot up initially but we still have a little bit of

06:26.280 --> 06:27.300
setup left to do.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.020
And this last little bit is certainly let me tell you.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.690
It is definitely the painful part.

06:31.700 --> 06:37.830
This is the part where you definitely made the right decision by checking on my course because otherwise

06:37.830 --> 06:42.210
there are not a lot of solutions online for troubleshooting this last little bit.

06:42.420 --> 06:47.490
So I'm not going to tell you exactly what the problem is we are just going to jump to the solution and

06:47.580 --> 06:51.190
what a solution it is at my start menu.

06:51.240 --> 07:00.630
You can open it up and then I'm going to search for system settings and the result I should get here

07:00.630 --> 07:02.510
is view advanced system settings.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.060
Go ahead and click it and then I get my system properties window right here.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.900
This my little bit familiar if ever you know mess around with Windows that much.

07:10.920 --> 07:16.060
I've got tabs like computer name hardware and advanced Zonday advanced window.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.390
I want to click on environment variables.

07:18.420 --> 07:23.790
So we're going to add to environment variables to Windows.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.090
The first one that we're going to add a click on new.

07:27.660 --> 07:32.820
And then I'm going to enter a name of Java home.

07:32.970 --> 07:38.460
So by default the react native package or the thing that kind of like builds or application expects

07:38.460 --> 07:43.770
to have access to this environment variable called Java home but by default it doesn't actually exist

07:43.950 --> 07:46.020
on a brand new operating system.

07:46.020 --> 07:50.730
One thing I want to mention is that if you already have a variable of Java home you do not need to add

07:50.730 --> 07:51.290
this one in.

07:51.300 --> 07:56.670
So if you scan over this list you'll see one that says Java home you don't need to go to this process.

07:56.850 --> 08:01.110
But if you do not see each other home go ahead and click on that new button and add the variable name

08:01.110 --> 08:02.350
of Java home.

08:02.700 --> 08:10.440
Then for a variable value we will click on browse directory and the window that pops up I'll click on

08:10.530 --> 08:14.410
this PC I'll click on the C-Drive.

08:14.880 --> 08:24.380
I click on program files all expand Java and finally I will select the JDK that we just installed.

08:24.390 --> 08:31.360
So JDK 1.8 and I'll click OK and then ok again.

08:31.440 --> 08:38.850
So now I have a environment variable of Java underscore home and the value of Seberg and philes Java

08:39.120 --> 08:40.750
JDK blah blah blah.

08:41.260 --> 08:41.510
All right.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.880
One other thing that we need to do.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.310
We also need to add in a nother directory to our path variable.

08:47.340 --> 08:53.830
So on this list of different environment variables you should already have one listed here called Path.

08:53.850 --> 08:55.220
So definitely scroll up and down.

08:55.240 --> 09:03.750
I guarantee you you have it I'll click on it because I want to edit my path and then I will click on

09:03.870 --> 09:09.570
new on the right hand side top right hand side and you can see right here we can enter in a path.

09:09.570 --> 09:16.380
So if you recall when we were going through the Android studio setup I said hey check out your user

09:16.380 --> 09:17.400
name right there right.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.870
And for me it was computer for you was whatever your username is.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.280
This is where that is relevant.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.040
OK so this is where we're going to make use of that.

09:25.050 --> 09:28.530
So I like to enter in my path.

09:28.530 --> 09:34.260
So I'll put in see a user's computer.

09:34.260 --> 09:40.350
So again for me it is computer for you is what it is whatever of your logon username is.

09:40.350 --> 09:43.140
For me it's computer for you it will be something different.

09:43.620 --> 09:46.530
And then we're going to point it to app data

09:49.480 --> 09:49.990
local

09:53.860 --> 10:03.160
Android SDK platform Dowst tools like so as a quick little check just to make sure that I have the right

10:03.160 --> 10:03.870
link.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.080
I'm going to copy this link so I select everything I'm going to copy it.

10:08.320 --> 10:14.850
I'm going to then open up windows explorer paste the link and just verify.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.420
Yes this directory exists here.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.370
So again just go ahead.

10:18.370 --> 10:22.450
Copy that link paste into Windows Explorer verify that it exists.

10:22.510 --> 10:26.860
If you get an error message popping up that says like hey the directory doesn't exist chances are you

10:26.860 --> 10:28.820
entered in the incorrect username.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.100
So make sure that you've got the correct use made for your log in on your particular machine.

10:34.270 --> 10:34.650
OK.

10:34.700 --> 10:42.940
Now that this is all done click OK I'll click OK click OK and the last Im going to do is restart my

10:42.940 --> 10:44.180
command prompt now.

10:44.430 --> 10:47.440
So I'm going to close the command prompt.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.110
I will open it back up by searching for Command.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.560
Right click on it run as an illustrator.

10:56.500 --> 11:01.750
And now we are finally ready to actually test our application inside of the emulator.

11:01.930 --> 11:07.990
So I'm going to change back to my project directory which for me is on my drive.

11:11.890 --> 11:14.610
So I'm now inside of my project directory.

11:14.740 --> 11:19.060
It'll be whatever your working directory is and wherever you put your projects for me I'm calling it

11:19.060 --> 11:19.950
Riak native.

11:20.260 --> 11:23.920
And then the name of the project that we just generated which is albums.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.200
So the very last step inside of your.

11:26.230 --> 11:32.980
I will write out re-act dash native run dash Android.

11:33.570 --> 11:37.450
This is all very telling us with you this is the absolute moment of truth right here.

11:37.720 --> 11:43.330
As to whether or not this is going to work when I run that command you'll see another window pop up.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.970
This is the re-act native packager.

11:44.980 --> 11:50.890
This is what takes all of our javascript code compresses it all down into a single javascript file and

11:50.890 --> 11:55.510
then makes it available to the device and then over here back to the original window.

11:55.510 --> 12:01.180
Our application is building for the Android device and it's then going to automatically install and

12:01.240 --> 12:02.560
open it on the device

12:08.180 --> 12:08.870
and there we go.

12:08.870 --> 12:15.110
So installing JPK on app debugger OK and then we can see everything pop up over your on the right hand

12:15.110 --> 12:16.200
side.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.280
Fetching javascript bundled that means that it is pulling that all the starter code and then eventually

12:21.290 --> 12:22.400
Yup there we go.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.920
Welcome to react native.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.260
So by default.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.630
To refresh any code.

12:26.660 --> 12:30.260
I know that I'm going to give you a little bit of instructions right now that are very particular to

12:30.260 --> 12:34.490
Android and I know they might not make a ton of sense until we start writing some code.

12:34.490 --> 12:36.440
I just want to mention them very quickly.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.080
First off by default.

12:38.090 --> 12:44.810
To refresh our simulator or to get any changes to our Kobasew we've made we can follow the directions

12:44.810 --> 12:45.320
right on here.

12:45.320 --> 12:52.520
So just double tap r to refresh and as you can see it makes another request for a javascript Lundell.

12:52.520 --> 12:57.230
The other thing I want to mention is shake or press menu button for dev menu.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.620
So looking down here.

12:58.650 --> 13:04.760
OK I don't really see any menu menu button like it makes reference to look in the right side.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.890
I also don't see any.

13:06.080 --> 13:11.630
So here's a little trick to open up this Desmond knew that it's talking about we can press control in

13:12.130 --> 13:14.750
and that opens up the development menu.

13:14.990 --> 13:20.660
So as I worked through the course I will be using the Iowas simulator bible many times say OK I'm going

13:20.660 --> 13:24.110
to open up my development menu right here.

13:24.200 --> 13:31.730
We are on Android do that by pressing control in and again just to be clear whenever I refer to refresh

13:31.730 --> 13:32.600
on the application.

13:32.630 --> 13:36.240
We will double tap our to refresh our simulator.

13:36.620 --> 13:37.540
OK so that's it.

13:37.580 --> 13:42.710
We got our Android emulator up and worked on the last thing I want to mention to you is hey we went

13:42.710 --> 13:44.850
through all this process just to get to your.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.570
What happens when I close everything.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.630
How do I get everything started back up.

13:48.740 --> 13:53.270
So once you close everything you know let's say you shut down your computer for the night or whatever

13:53.270 --> 13:54.120
it might be.

13:54.170 --> 14:00.910
You can get started again by opening up your Android studio again.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.020
You can open up your re-act native project again.

14:04.130 --> 14:06.620
You'll go back up to the tools menu.

14:06.860 --> 14:13.550
Android HDD manager and then click the play button on the right that will start up the emulator and

14:13.550 --> 14:19.550
then inside of our command line at the command prompt We will change into our project directory and

14:19.610 --> 14:23.960
run the same command again re-act dashed native run dashin Android.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.520
So those are the two steps for getting started back up.

14:26.540 --> 14:30.860
If you ever decide to take a break or shut down your computer for the night or whatever it might be

14:31.340 --> 14:33.230
Riak native running Android.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.000
And don't forget to start up the emulators.

14:35.010 --> 14:35.640
Well.

14:36.360 --> 14:43.670
OK so I hope this didn't seem that bad because trust me I spent a tremendous amount of time poring over

14:43.700 --> 14:48.740
Android's set up getting it down to like just the bare essentials of what you need to install to get

14:48.740 --> 14:49.520
started.

14:49.850 --> 14:51.570
So hopefully everything is working out.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.760
Let's continue and start working on our first application in the next section.
