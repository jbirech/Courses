00:01.090 --> 00:06.240
In this section we are going to get started with re-act native on our windows development environment.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.550
So if you're running Mac OSX if you're on a Mac right now you can skip this section and go onto the

00:11.550 --> 00:12.220
next one.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.800
If you're on Windows stay here.

00:14.790 --> 00:19.050
You know you can tell because I got the big ole Windows logo on the screen here you know you're in the

00:19.050 --> 00:22.050
right spot if you're in Windows so to speak.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.280
All right let's go and get started.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.100
We need to install a lot of different software so I'm going to be honest with you.

00:27.120 --> 00:33.120
Set up of reac native on Android or excuse me on Windows is a little bit tough because there's a lot

00:33.120 --> 00:34.230
of stuff to install.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.600
So we're going to go through it.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.360
We're going to do our best to install just one thing at a time.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.470
But sometimes it's you know it might save us a little bit to install two things simultaneously because

00:43.500 --> 00:45.730
you know sometimes it's just a long download.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.340
Anyways let's get started.

00:47.340 --> 00:55.260
The first thing I'm going to do is open up my browser and just because I'm on Windows I'm going to use

00:55.260 --> 00:56.080
Internet Explorer.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.390
No reason in particular but I am going to use Google rather than being.

01:01.890 --> 01:07.540
All right so the first thing we're going to install is the java JDK or you know really STK But what

01:07.540 --> 01:08.210
are JDK.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.730
Sure.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.260
This is not a.

01:11.450 --> 01:13.770
So we're going to search for Java SDK.

01:13.770 --> 01:16.620
This is not necessarily a prerequisite for re-act native.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.710
This is really a prerequisite for running Java apps of any type.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.870
Or excuse me Android apps of any type.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.320
So I'm going to search for Java SDK.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.940
And then the first result.

01:25.980 --> 01:30.090
Java Sea dash downloads will go there.

01:30.450 --> 01:35.860
Now on this page there is a very prominent download button to download Java platform JDK.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.340
I'm currently in version 8.

01:37.380 --> 01:40.920
If there is a more recent version no problem go for it.

01:41.220 --> 01:41.780
So we are.

01:41.820 --> 01:44.460
We will download at the next page.

01:44.460 --> 01:49.600
We need to select the operating system that we are downloading this JDK for.

01:49.800 --> 01:56.880
So on the Java as the development kit right here I will first accept the license agreement and then

01:56.880 --> 01:59.470
I will find a selection for Windows 64.

01:59.600 --> 02:04.840
So sure right here let's install it and we get prompted to run this thing.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.650
Yep sounds great.

02:07.860 --> 02:12.810
And again I know we could start off another installation of all these things downloading but I really

02:12.810 --> 02:14.900
wanted to to as much as possible.

02:14.900 --> 02:21.040
Run one thing at a time because otherwise it gets confusing because of just clicking all over the place.

02:21.150 --> 02:24.900
So after the download is finished we all start up the installation

02:30.030 --> 02:30.920
and there we go.

02:30.930 --> 02:33.190
So next I mean you know the deal.

02:33.210 --> 02:34.240
You know the drill.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.540
Next next next next next and we are done with the installation

02:42.990 --> 02:46.150
if you see a destination folder pop up right here that's no problem.

02:46.150 --> 02:46.930
Just click next.

02:46.950 --> 02:48.510
All also.

02:48.810 --> 02:53.800
And finally we are actually installing the library and it should just take a moment or two.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.160
Like I said a moment or two.

03:02.170 --> 03:02.770
There you go.

03:02.770 --> 03:03.740
Fantastic.

03:03.740 --> 03:09.270
So now I've got the Java JDK installed on my system so we'll go ahead and close that.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.450
And we are down step one now.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.950
We still have a lot of steps to go through.

03:12.970 --> 03:14.790
So let's continue going.

03:14.950 --> 03:20.800
The next thing I'm going to install I'm going to first flip back over to Google and I need to go through

03:20.830 --> 03:22.330
the installation of Node.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.420
Yes.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.150
Note Yes.

03:24.190 --> 03:29.920
Is all about running Javascript outside of the browser environment so kind of running it in a desktop

03:29.920 --> 03:31.050
environment dead.

03:31.240 --> 03:37.510
We are installing node for two purposes first because we need to use node to generate our application

03:37.510 --> 03:42.510
bundles that kind of take all the javascript to be right and stuff it down all into one file to serve

03:42.520 --> 03:43.990
up on our mobile device.

03:44.110 --> 03:49.230
And we also use node for package management as well as where we will find just a second.

03:49.510 --> 03:52.110
So after a while I'm going to do a search for node.

03:52.450 --> 03:56.080
I will go click on the link and then you get prompted for a download.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.270
You can either go with the stable download or the current download current version is completely up

04:01.270 --> 04:01.710
to you.

04:01.750 --> 04:07.210
I usually just run with the current version because it has access to all the latest features.

04:07.210 --> 04:12.370
But you know what the heck I'll change things up and go with the current version instead.

04:12.370 --> 04:19.090
So I'm going to download the installer for Windows again Windows 64.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.550
It's a very quick download and.

04:21.620 --> 04:26.330
OK well you know I've already got no word installed here and it's a later version so I guess I already

04:26.330 --> 04:30.140
had 6.6 Sung's get hit OK and kind of be done with it.

04:30.220 --> 04:34.930
Of course if you do not have node installed certainly go through that process again.

04:34.930 --> 04:35.970
So that's it for now.

04:35.980 --> 04:37.590
Very quick install as well.

04:37.630 --> 04:42.420
We're going to move on to one last installation inside this video and then we'll continue in the next

04:42.420 --> 04:42.790
one.

04:42.790 --> 04:46.910
So the last thing we're going to look for is flip back over to Google again.

04:47.320 --> 04:53.950
And the last thing to look for is Python to search for Python 2.

04:53.980 --> 04:58.640
And here's my download link right here download Python Python dot org.

04:59.650 --> 05:05.770
And very promptly we are prompted for download the latest version for Windows we want version 2 of Python

05:05.770 --> 05:07.610
not version 3 version 2.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.010
So I will download Python run it.

05:13.780 --> 05:19.690
And just like node I believe I already have this installed on my system so it might just give me a quick

05:19.690 --> 05:22.890
air but we'll see what we'll see what the result is.

05:25.010 --> 05:25.630
And OK.

05:25.650 --> 05:30.090
Yeah I've already got Python installed so it's prompted me to change repair or move.

05:30.140 --> 05:35.480
If you do not have Python installed again are you going to have to do is hit that next next next and

05:35.480 --> 05:36.660
you're good to go.

05:37.220 --> 05:41.690
OK so I know that I said that this was the last thing we're going to install but there are it's just

05:41.690 --> 05:46.350
one last thing that I want to start up for installation because it's going to save us a lot of time

05:46.350 --> 05:47.680
in the next section.

05:47.720 --> 05:57.970
So again over at Google I'm going to do a search for Android studio download and they're very prominently.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.690
Again you know it's fantastic.

05:59.710 --> 06:06.020
Thank goodness these are all the first links that pop up we find download India Android studio and SDK

06:06.020 --> 06:07.280
tools.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.110
So we'll click on that link and then very prominently on here just a little bit down the page is download

06:12.120 --> 06:13.350
Android studio.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.270
So we'll start this download off.

06:15.480 --> 06:21.410
And as you see this is not an instant download this is 1.6 gigabytes large So there's a lot of stuff

06:21.410 --> 06:23.210
to have to pull in here.

06:23.450 --> 06:28.730
So we will start up the download process for the Android studio and let's continue in the next section

06:28.850 --> 06:30.960
and start installing the Android studio
