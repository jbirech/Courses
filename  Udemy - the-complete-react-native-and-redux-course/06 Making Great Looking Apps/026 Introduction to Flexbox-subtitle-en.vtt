00:01.080 --> 00:04.210
In the last section we added some styling to our view tag.

00:04.470 --> 00:09.210
Remember the purpose of the tag was just to position the text element correctly on the screen.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.840
The text can't really position itself.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.970
We also set a background color on The View tag.

00:14.070 --> 00:19.490
And so now it's time to really make use of the view tag to position the album's text right and center

00:19.500 --> 00:24.560
middle here positioning elements in re-act native is a tricky little subject.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.930
And I normally wouldn't bring styling up so early in of course except for the fact that you know styling

00:30.930 --> 00:32.900
is really at the core of reac need.

00:32.910 --> 00:38.680
And for me personally one of the hardest challenges or most difficult aspects of Riak native.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.420
And so that's why we're tackling this nice and early.

00:42.330 --> 00:49.170
So by doing or to use positioning inside of reac native We use a technique called Flex box.

00:49.200 --> 00:55.170
Now the term flex box is a reference to how we will position elements it's kind of a CSSA positioning

00:55.170 --> 00:56.430
technology.

00:56.610 --> 01:02.940
If you've worked with flex flex box in normal CSSA before on standard web apps it mostly works the same

01:02.940 --> 01:03.560
way here.

01:03.570 --> 01:07.060
There's a couple of very small differences that I'll point out over time.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.320
So let me give you a plain text definition of flex box.

01:11.370 --> 01:16.450
Fluxbox is a system of positioning elements within the container.

01:16.500 --> 01:26.010
In our case we have a containing element of view and the child element of the text we can use fluxbox

01:26.070 --> 01:33.270
to tell a re-act native how we want to position the text tag within the overall view tag.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.930
So let's check out a couple of couple of diagrams to get a little bit better idea of how this works.

01:38.940 --> 01:45.420
So why do people want to first make it really clear everything and reac native gets positioned to the

01:45.420 --> 01:49.420
top left of its parent just as you would expect with normal age T.M..

01:49.830 --> 01:55.440
So if we do not finagle with that view or that text any point in time it's going to look exactly like

01:55.440 --> 01:56.250
this.

01:56.340 --> 02:01.460
The text albums is going to appear at the top left hand side of the overall view container.

02:01.590 --> 02:06.600
So it's kind of don't know orangy look and color right here is supposed to be the view container.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.920
And so if we look at the simulator right now.

02:08.940 --> 02:16.000
Yeah that's definitely the case that's appearing at the top left of the view so there are two properties

02:16.000 --> 02:21.630
that we need to be aware of to get our text to be centered in the very middle of the view.

02:21.700 --> 02:27.250
The first is justified content and the second is a line items.

02:27.280 --> 02:33.370
These are two property names that we'll use inside of our styling object to get the text tag to move

02:33.370 --> 02:35.310
to the center of the view tag.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.720
So let's examine both these properties.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.740
First we're going to start off with the justify content property that justified content property is

02:44.740 --> 02:47.870
used to position elements in the vertical direction.

02:48.280 --> 02:53.350
So to move something from the very top left you say downwards.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.670
Now I say let me let me throw out one small caveat here.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.580
Usually the justified content property is used to position elements in the vertical direction.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.980
There is one case where it behaves a little bit differently.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.870
That's all I want to say right now and I'm only saying that because if you're familiar with flex blocks

03:10.870 --> 03:15.680
you probably grit your teeth and say Stephen that's not the only thing justify content does.

03:16.030 --> 03:22.090
But again forget that let's just focus on in context right now what justified content does.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.030
So we can give justify content a couple of different values to change where it places our content.

03:28.030 --> 03:34.860
If we give it the string flex dash and it will push our text down to the very bottom.

03:34.990 --> 03:42.100
Likewise we can give it Center as a string and it will push the element to the very center middle but

03:42.100 --> 03:47.320
still all the way to the left hand side justify content right now is not moving our element from the

03:47.320 --> 03:50.420
left to the right.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.960
Finally the last one is really relevant right now.

03:52.960 --> 03:58.690
There's a couple of others that we'll cover later on in the course is justified content flex dash start

03:59.010 --> 04:04.660
and that behaves much the same as the default which is to not provide a justified content property at

04:04.660 --> 04:09.330
all in which case it will just appear on the very very top.

04:09.680 --> 04:15.900
So you won't find us using flex start too often because that's generally the default behavior anyways.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.730
So there's a couple of other items as well.

04:18.730 --> 04:22.920
Like I mentioned that we'll figure out later on as we move through the course.

04:22.930 --> 04:28.180
So this is justified content again has to move elements up and down the second property that we want

04:28.180 --> 04:33.730
to be aware of is the A line items property with a line items.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.520
We position elements in the horizontal direction.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.680
So we're talking about moving the text from left to right.

04:39.760 --> 04:46.450
We have much the same properties as with justified content we can say start and we'll start at the very

04:46.450 --> 04:53.740
left and we can use center to center it and we can use end to push it all the way to the far right hand

04:53.740 --> 04:55.020
side.

04:55.090 --> 05:02.120
So again whereas justify content is about manipulating items in the up and down direction a line item

05:02.200 --> 05:05.990
is about manipulating it in the left and right.

05:06.040 --> 05:13.090
So the idea here is that we can combine justified content and the line items to exactly Center an item

05:13.090 --> 05:14.470
in a container.

05:14.470 --> 05:19.070
Again that's not all there is to flex box but it is all we need to know for right now.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.030
So let's take what we've learned in this section and apply it to our head or component in the next section.
