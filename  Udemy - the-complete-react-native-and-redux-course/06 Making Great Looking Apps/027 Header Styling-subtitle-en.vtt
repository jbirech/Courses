00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.170
In the last section we had a discussion on flex box in particular the two properties justified content

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.850
and the line items.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.700
These two properties can be applied to container styling and all because any elements within the container

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.940
to be positioned in a certain fashion.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.870
So again we're going to be.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.780
We're going to be applying the justify content and the on line items properties to the view tag that's

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.010
going to cause our text tagged to move around on the screen.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.460
So let's fix up our view style here we're going to add on a couple of more properties first because

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.280
we want to center the text tag on the screen.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.310
We only use justified content of center to move it halfway down the view tag and then align items center

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.300
to move it halfway across the tag.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.030
I'm also going to apply a set height of 60 and a padding top to it at the same time.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.010
I made sure I got all my commas in there as well.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.020
So height behaves just as you would expect.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.730
We can pass it a pixel value and we will get 60 pixels on the screen and padding top behaves just the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.250
same way as it does on.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.150
Excuse me CSSA as well a lot of padding to the top of the element.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870
So I'm going to save this.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290
And let's check out how the header looks now.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.910
All right.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.040
Definitely big improvement.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.000
It's not inside the network tag anymore.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.960
We've got it nicely centered beneath the networking bar so it doesn't look half bad.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.150
Now the next thing I want to do with this header component is make sure we kind of get a bottom border

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.270
here as well.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
Again the video doesn't quite convey it I'm sure but there's come to settle off white or kind of gray

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.540
looking color to the header and by adding on a bottom border of sorts it kind of just add to distinguish

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.390
between the header and any other content that we have on the screen.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.820
So let's walk through adding on a couple of more properties to this view style tag rather than giving

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.770
just a solid border color like you know just a border or a straight line.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.690
We'll use a shadow property.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.190
So a shadow property is going to make it appear that there's kind of shadowing at the bottom of the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.110
header to add on a shadow.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.400
We use a couple of different properties.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.200
First we'll specify a shadow color.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.200
This will say hey I want there to be a shadow on this element.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.000
Please use this color and I will say just use black.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.640
Next we'll define a shadow offset or shadow offset is what actually tells the element.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.110
Hey here is exactly the dimensions of the shadow or how tall or how wide it should be.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310
We want a width of zero.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.420
So there will be no shadowing on the left or the right hand side.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.630
But there will be a height to it.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.840
So you know vertical of two pixels.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.460
And finally we'll give it a shadow shadow opacity of 0.2 shadow pass you right here is kind of the darkness

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.950
of the shadow or how heavy it is.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.040
So let's now check this out inside of the browser.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.510
Excuse me simulator.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.870
And now OK this is looking pretty good.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.150
We've got a nice shadow on here as well.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.960
You can play around these properties a whole bunch.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.960
So maybe I'll give it like you know a height of 20.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.180
Now it really extends up and down that's definitely way too much.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.100
So I go back to two.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.070
I can also play around with the opacity as well so I can go all the way up to say like you know point

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.740
nine.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300
It's a number that ranges between 1 and 0.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.050
So at 9 it starts to get really dark.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.740
You could go all the way down to like say point 5 that starts to look pretty reasonable as well but

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.640
I'm going to run with just the default of 0.2 if you want to use something darker.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.510
You certainly can.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.900
It's totally up to you.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.570
Now there's two final properties I want to play I'm place on this view style.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.960
They're not super relevant right now but they will be relevant later on.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.160
And certainly we will come back to the component and discuss why replacing them here.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.380
But we're just going to kind of do it right now and just kind of accept it and then talk about why they're

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.420
here later on.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.880
So I'm also going to add on the property elevation of two and a position of relative again.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.220
We're going to come back and discuss these properties we'll deal with it later on.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.740
All right let's give one last look at our component here.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.180
It's looking pretty darn good.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.650
This is a great start for application.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.690
Let's continue with the rest of our app and the next section.
