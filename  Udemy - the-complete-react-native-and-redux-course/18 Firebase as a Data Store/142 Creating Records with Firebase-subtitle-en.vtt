00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.920
Were continued to make really good progress inside site application users can enter some names some

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.840
phone number and a shift in here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.650
All we do now is take those little pieces of data and save it over to firebase whenever a user presses

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.730
the create button down here.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260
Now I bet you know what's going to come next.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.690
We're going to create an event handler on the button whenever it is pressed we will call an action creator

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.720
and this action creator will attempt to save our data the firebase if it is successful we will navigate

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.450
the user back to the employee list screen.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.790
Give me a roadmap here.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.540
So we're going to hook up the button make the action create or save the record and then navigate back

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.280
to the employee list screen where the user can then see their new employee pop up on the list.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
So it's going to be a little bit of a chunk of work.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430
So let's get right down to it.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.300
The first thing we'll do inside of our employee create component.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.840
We're going to find that button and we're going to wire up an event handler on it.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.230
It's going to scroll down to our button and we'll put on here on Press and we'll have this call a helper

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:14.160
method that we're going to create in just a second which we'll call on button press on because it is

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.440
a callback is going to make reference to this.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.790
We're going to make sure to bind the context then we'll scroll back up to the top and define on button

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.240
press.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
Now inside if we do not yet have an action create or to call we haven't really made anything to save

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.600
or create employees anything like that.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.290
I'm just going to assume that we're going to make an action crater called something like you know let's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.800
call it employee create all that's going to be the name of our action creator.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.380
So I'm going to assume that we're going to call employee create with our name phone number and shift

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780
time.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.640
So I'm going to take my name phone and shift out of our prop's object.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.050
And then I will call this action creator that we will make in just a second called employee creates

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.450
and I'm going to pass it an object that contains the name phone and shift.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.530
OK so this looks good so far.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.590
Let's make that action creator and then hook it up to this component.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.120
I'm going to open up my employee actions file.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.720
So inside my actions director and a fine employee actions member this is we're going to locate all the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.500
action creators having to do with employees in any way shape or form and we'll create the action creator

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.160
so say expert Konst employee create and we're going to receive an object that contains a name a phone

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.900
and a shift

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.010
all right I'm going to flip back to our component and just immediately hook up this action creator because

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.080
it usually ends up being the one thing that I forget to do all the time.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:09.530
So back inside of our employed create component we will import employee create from our actions file

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.280
and then we will pass this down at the Kinect handler at the very bottom of this file.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.360
So scroll down to the bottom find my connect helper and this line is getting a little bit long so I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.060
think I'm going to newline it and I'll pass an employee create.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.800
So now my component has access to the action creator as this props Propst employee create and then is

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.360
exactly how we used it inside of our on button press handler right here now whenever we use add in any

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.910
info here send off to the action Krater just to make sure that we're going down the right path.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.090
I'm going to add an action creator inside or excuse me I going out a console log inside the action creator

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:59.150
just to console log the value of name phone and shift or log the stuffier make sure that we're going

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.610
down the right path.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.240
So I'm going to refresh the simulator now.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.970
And we're just going to confirm that we are like doing the right thing.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.510
I'll bring up my debugger.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.100
Here's my debugger so we can see the console log.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.360
And then I'll say test at test dot com password.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.390
You log in with some good credentials.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.140
And now when I get to the form I'm going to do something very pretty.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.140
I'm not going to touch anything here just yet.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.270
OK I'm going to enter only a name of Jane

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.720
and a phone number.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.520
I am not going to touch shift.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.780
So you'll notice that I did not touch that shift picker at all.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.090
I didn't spin it around I didn't do a single darn thing.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.940
Let's create now and see what happens.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.960
So I get a big red error message here which is totally fine.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.400
It says actions must be plane objects.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.600
The action career that we just created is not actually returning an action.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.770
And so redux is complaining about that.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.560
That's totally fine.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.720
Totally what I expected but I want to point something out to you above those air messages that we got

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.160
right here.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.530
We got on the log and you'll see that we have a console log with Jane which is the name the five five

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.570
five phone number.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.870
But then there is no shift being logged here.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.570
All right.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.890
Let's flip back over to employee create I am con. logging shift but it appears that shift just didn't

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.780
get logged at all.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.300
And what this actually means is that shift is undefined.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.390
Shift is undefined here.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.470
So clearly there is something funky going on with that picture something isn't quite behaving the way

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.350
we expect.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
We are not getting a shift assigned in our reducer.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.930
So let's take a quick break and then come back and do a little bit of trouble shooting and try to figure

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.890
out why this shift is ending up as undefined right here.
