00:01.490 --> 00:06.240
In the last section we did a little bit of testing of our form only to find out that if we did not touch

00:06.240 --> 00:09.880
the picker at all the shift would come up as undefined.

00:09.930 --> 00:11.240
So why would that be why.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.230
Why is shift coming up is undefined but appears.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.900
Everything else on here is working correctly.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.200
Remember the state of our form is being held by our employee form reducer.

00:22.740 --> 00:29.850
By default the employee form inducer does not have a starting or initial value for any element in the

00:29.850 --> 00:30.390
form.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.370
Why has an empty string.

00:31.380 --> 00:38.910
But you know essentially doesn't really have anything to picture itself visually defaults to being Monday.

00:38.940 --> 00:39.150
Right.

00:39.150 --> 00:45.120
So like when we logged in and looked at that form that picture appears to be on Monday by default but

00:45.120 --> 00:48.100
that is just the visual behavior of that picture.

00:48.210 --> 00:52.510
It's not actually selecting Monday for us it's just defaulting to that value.

00:52.770 --> 00:56.100
So even though it looks like oh yeah we've got Monday selected here.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.380
I have a shift a Monday.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.870
We are never actually making any change or calling any actually creator inside our application to update

01:03.930 --> 01:08.000
the shift value inside of her or induce her to be Monday.

01:08.010 --> 01:09.510
So that's essentially what's happening here.

01:09.750 --> 01:15.120
We think that the value is being set but we never actually update the reducer to say hey it should be

01:15.120 --> 01:16.080
Monday.

01:16.110 --> 01:21.840
Now of course if I changed the reduce or excuse me if I change the picture right here that will initiate

01:21.840 --> 01:26.580
a change that will call an action crater right because we said all that stuff up and then shift will

01:26.580 --> 01:30.050
be set to you know Tuesday Wednesday Thursday whatever it might be.

01:30.240 --> 01:35.420
But if a user opens up the form does not touch the shift does not touch the picker at all.

01:35.460 --> 01:38.290
It's going to stay as just empty string.

01:38.820 --> 01:44.730
But by the way just to be really clear I probably made a little bit of a stated the WRONG WRONG thing

01:44.730 --> 01:47.910
I said in the last section that shift was coming up is undefined.

01:47.910 --> 01:53.270
In fact it was really empty string that was probably a little bit of a verbal typo on my my side.

01:53.270 --> 02:00.210
So it would be more correct to say shift is empty string and not undefined when we log it anyways.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.080
There's definitely more than one way to solve this problem right here.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.340
Definitely more than one way WAY.

02:05.340 --> 02:07.230
So I throw out a couple of different ways in here.

02:07.260 --> 02:12.510
I don't personally feel very strongly about any one solution so I'm going to suggest a solution but

02:12.510 --> 02:16.160
if there's one that sounds better to you then absolutely go for it.

02:16.210 --> 02:22.170
All of these these solutions are going to outline I think are all reasonable solutions.

02:22.590 --> 02:25.580
So the first solution that might do is inside the reducer.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.750
I had this initial state object right here.

02:27.750 --> 02:33.320
I could instead of defaulting shift to empty string I could defaulted to Monday.

02:33.450 --> 02:38.010
So that means that when this form is first rendered I will have a shift of Monday set.

02:38.010 --> 02:41.630
If the user does not touch the picker then no problem.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.710
We've got a shift a Monday in there by default.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.240
Everything's good to go.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.770
The one downside to this approach right here I'm going to mention is that it really does.

02:49.770 --> 02:57.340
However it really tightly couples the options in the picker like the days of the week to this reducer

02:57.360 --> 02:57.800
right here.

02:57.810 --> 03:04.080
So if you for some reason end up changing the picker options to add like hours of the day instead of

03:04.080 --> 03:10.130
actual days well then you have to update that in both the picker file and the actual form and the reducer

03:10.170 --> 03:10.740
here.

03:10.740 --> 03:17.430
So a very small con but I am going to mention that as being a con so I'm I'm not going to go with that

03:17.430 --> 03:17.880
path.

03:17.870 --> 03:20.940
So I'm going to leave shift as empty string right here.

03:20.970 --> 03:26.490
The second option that we could do is to add a component will mount inside of our employee create form

03:26.880 --> 03:32.400
and as soon as this component is mounted to the dorm or out the door but mounted on a device as soon

03:32.400 --> 03:37.860
as it is rendered we can call the action creator manually and say hey let's make sure that we default

03:37.860 --> 03:43.430
the value of shift to to be Monday or whatever we might want to default to be.

03:43.590 --> 03:47.260
So that's definitely another valuable option if you want to go that path as well.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.650
The final option and I think what we're going to do in here because it involves the probably the least

03:52.650 --> 04:00.690
amount of code besides the reducers solution is when we call the action creator employee create right

04:00.690 --> 04:07.650
here we can default the value of shift so we can just say if a shift is not set then by default use

04:07.650 --> 04:08.260
Monday.

04:08.340 --> 04:12.330
I think that's reasonably clear.

04:12.330 --> 04:16.200
It makes sure that when we call the action crater itself there is an actual value in there.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.260
Of course the other option could be in the crater itself.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.900
We could include a shift.

04:21.930 --> 04:25.200
You know that's also an option we could default the value of shift.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.080
Again there's a lot of different approaches here.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.020
I'm just going to arbitrarily pick this one.

04:29.160 --> 04:37.720
So I get to say when we call employee creates if a shift is not provided then we use Monday like so.

04:38.670 --> 04:45.960
So for the shift key use either the shift that has been set by the form or if one is not set defaulted

04:45.960 --> 04:47.140
to Monday.

04:47.160 --> 04:52.920
Now the one thing that we got to be really aware of here we're exploiting a little bit of a workaround

04:53.040 --> 04:54.750
you might say in javascript's.

04:54.900 --> 05:02.220
We are counting on the fact that our reduce our producers shift as a empty string by default which is

05:02.220 --> 05:04.390
a false value in Javascript.

05:04.380 --> 05:08.310
So if I say you know over here let's do a quick example.

05:08.400 --> 05:15.260
If I say empty string or Monday the return result will be Monday so early exploiting a little loophole

05:15.260 --> 05:16.620
in javascript right here.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.920
It is not the clearest thing in the world so it's a little bit of a rough spot.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.330
We might come up with a better solution here.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.260
OK long lecture there.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.430
No real long lecture but I think you get the idea now.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.930
By default our pickers should always have a value set to it.

05:32.550 --> 05:38.310
So the next thing we have to do is make sure that whenever our employee create action crater's called

05:38.550 --> 05:41.330
we actually see this thing off to firebase.

05:41.640 --> 05:46.290
I have to say to sing off to firebase Let's take a quick break come back in the next section and do

05:46.290 --> 05:48.000
that actual save process.
