00:01.040 --> 00:04.080
Intellectually added some styling to our card component.

00:04.080 --> 00:09.340
So I think it's probably already to go from the visual side but now we need to build to use it in somehow.

00:09.330 --> 00:09.560
Right.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.230
We've got to really use the card component we just made so really quick.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.340
I want to pop open a diagram that we're looking at a little bit ago.

00:16.980 --> 00:21.540
And the GSX on the right hand side we had said that the card was going to be kind of like the overall

00:21.540 --> 00:23.030
rectangle for this thing.

00:23.250 --> 00:29.400
And in the GSX you may have noticed that I put some other components within the card tag.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.460
Now we've already seen instances where we passed one component to another within sight of some tag but

00:35.460 --> 00:38.670
that was always when we used it with a view attack.

00:38.700 --> 00:44.960
So if I go back to my top level app component you'll see that I placed that tag and I gave you tagged

00:45.030 --> 00:47.340
the header in the album list.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.990
But right now we'll only know how to pass kind of data down into a component as a distinct prop.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.340
So we need to figure out some other different fashion to pass components around so that one component

00:59.340 --> 01:05.880
can render another much in the same way that that tag renders the header and the album list.

01:05.910 --> 01:10.500
So it's kind of hard to give you a really nice lead in into exactly how this works.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.540
So we're getting kind of just die right in and I can show you exactly how to do this first.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.230
I'm going to find the component that I want to wrap with a card component and so that's going to be

01:20.320 --> 01:21.890
our album detail.

01:22.140 --> 01:29.480
So inside the album detail I'm going to import card from card.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.220
Now here's how it's going to work.

01:31.230 --> 01:36.840
I'm just going replace the existing new tags that I have in here with the card component.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.210
So now I've got a card.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.910
And it's being passed the text.

01:41.250 --> 01:46.420
I'm not using the tag anymore from re-act native and Soller move that import off the top.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.170
OK.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.620
So this this looks like what we want right.

01:49.620 --> 01:56.520
We've got our component card and we are passing it to text tag but we need to now manually tell the

01:56.520 --> 02:03.060
card component hey if you get past any components you know if you get past a text or a card section

02:03.090 --> 02:08.580
or another view or whatever it might be you need to be responsible for rendering this at some point

02:08.580 --> 02:09.420
in time.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.750
So we have to instruct card on how to render any children then it gets passed directly.

02:15.750 --> 02:16.920
So here's how we do that.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.140
I'm going to flip back over toward car component.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.100
Here we go.

02:20.410 --> 02:26.120
And then we'll add in our proffer is my reference to prop's as the argument.

02:26.190 --> 02:27.840
Now here's the magic.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.960
Any time that we pass a component that we write another component that component will show up on the

02:33.960 --> 02:36.970
prop's object as props dot children.

02:37.290 --> 02:45.300
So if we just add a reference inside of our GSX to prop's children it will render any components that

02:45.300 --> 02:46.890
we passed to this current one.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.890
So now we can kind of imagine that by adding what we just added you know the reference to props to our

02:51.900 --> 02:52.760
children.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.250
We kind of took this text tag right here.

02:55.260 --> 03:00.780
They were passing the card inside of album detail and we're kind of just saying you know I just take

03:00.780 --> 03:05.780
that whole thing and just stick it right in here you know just stick it in between the two of tags.

03:05.880 --> 03:10.650
That's exactly what's going on by just adding this reference to props to our children.

03:11.070 --> 03:11.380
OK.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.330
So I think that we're now in a good spot.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.030
It was a good test inside the simulator.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.310
Let's pop up and the simulator will do a refresh

03:22.490 --> 03:24.440
and do a little bit of a reload.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.360
And there we go.

03:26.390 --> 03:27.100
All right.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.170
So we've got what looks like you know.

03:30.170 --> 03:30.770
All right.

03:30.830 --> 03:36.410
It's not super pretty just yet but we definitely have the card component in there.

03:36.440 --> 03:42.980
We've got a nice outline on the top and a shadow on the bottom and it appears that there is some margin

03:43.040 --> 03:44.660
on the left and right hand side.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.650
So you see that's the 5 pics that we had on either side.

03:47.820 --> 03:54.160
And in-between each card is the 10 of spacings so the cards are not exactly but up against each other

03:54.170 --> 03:56.020
some kind of space there.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.360
You also also notice we reclaimed the space at the top for the shadow on the header.

04:01.380 --> 04:05.230
That was actually getting obstructed before with what we had previously.

04:05.230 --> 04:05.510
OK.

04:05.510 --> 04:06.700
So this is looking pretty good.

04:06.710 --> 04:09.180
Our card component is now in use.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.990
Let's continue on the next section.
