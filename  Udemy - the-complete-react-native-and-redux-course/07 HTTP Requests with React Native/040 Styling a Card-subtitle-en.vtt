00:01.120 --> 00:04.970
In the last section we put together a new component for showing a card.

00:05.220 --> 00:10.410
The current purpose is just to look nice and wrap some other existing component as well.

00:10.410 --> 00:17.100
So it's going to be enhancing our viewer to Hansing the style of our application in some fashion with

00:17.190 --> 00:20.490
re-access applications if you have any background with that.

00:20.490 --> 00:23.990
It's kind of rare to make a component that just adds some amount of styling.

00:24.180 --> 00:29.400
But in re-act native because we want to have some reuse of style throughout our codebase and we don't

00:29.400 --> 00:31.750
have the benefit of separate CSSA files.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.530
It's a little bit more common to make standalone components whose sole purpose is to add some styling

00:37.530 --> 00:39.800
into the application.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.710
So let's add in some sense let's add in some styling here area member.

00:44.730 --> 00:50.580
Our goal for adding styling or the approach to use underneath the component we add a new object called

00:50.580 --> 00:56.810
styles that will be an object and then we'll give it a single property.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.730
And in this case we call it container style.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.810
Now I'm going to call this specifically a container style because it's going to be some styling that

01:03.810 --> 01:09.270
we're adding to this view tag right here and the whole purpose is you tag is to just wrap some other

01:09.270 --> 01:09.880
component.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.630
And so you can kind of think of it as being like a container.

01:12.660 --> 01:16.290
And so that's where I'm coming from with this word container cell right here.

01:16.560 --> 01:20.340
One thing I want to throw out there the names of all the style properties that we use throughout the

01:20.340 --> 01:22.490
course completely arbitrary.

01:22.500 --> 01:26.970
I'm just kind of picking them not necessarily at random you know I'm putting some thought into it but

01:27.150 --> 01:32.970
you can change it from container style to anything else you might want to have so totally up to you.

01:33.130 --> 01:38.170
Now I want to make apologize or I want to apologize right now because we're going to add a lot of styles

01:38.170 --> 01:40.450
to this container style right here a lot of typing.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.050
So let's just get to it.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.240
We'll just power through all the styling.

01:44.260 --> 01:47.280
Once you've done it I think we'll both be really happy to be done.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.320
So let's get started.

01:48.520 --> 01:54.200
First off we're going to give this card a border so we'll assign a border with one.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.620
This says put a border around the component and give it a pixel width of one.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.380
So a nice thin border around the outside.

02:02.470 --> 02:09.940
Next we'll give it a border radius of two a border radius says at any corners of my component rounded

02:10.080 --> 02:10.930
them off nicely.

02:10.930 --> 02:15.670
So it just kind of rounded edges rounded corners excuse me.

02:15.670 --> 02:20.400
Next a border color of DDD.

02:20.430 --> 02:25.520
So this border color right here is going to give us a nice light gray border along the outside.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.260
And finally for the border.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.890
We'll give it a border bottom with a zero.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.400
So we assign the border with them of one up above.

02:35.410 --> 02:41.080
But for the bottom of the border the bottom segment we're saying don't give it with just hide the border

02:41.080 --> 02:42.400
entirely.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.190
So the reason for this is related to the parts section or card item component that we're going to work

02:48.190 --> 02:48.880
on later.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.120
So there is a reason the word kind of zeroing out the border there.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.830
We'll discuss it once we get to that card item.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.340
So that's it for borders.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.410
Next we'll get this thing a shadow.

02:59.410 --> 03:04.240
The purpose of the shadow is just to give the thing a little bit of pop or a little bit of elevation

03:04.330 --> 03:05.370
appearance to it right.

03:05.380 --> 03:11.080
It just makes it feel like the heart is something you get kind of picked up and drag off the screen.

03:11.080 --> 03:24.040
So start off with a shadow color of 000 a shadow offset with the with a zero and a height of two.

03:24.130 --> 03:28.590
Remember that the shadow offset specifies what side we want the shadow to be on.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.930
So I don't want any shadow on the left and right side.

03:31.060 --> 03:36.830
But I do want a height to the shadow so it's going to appear to have some shadowing to the bottom.

03:36.850 --> 03:44.500
Next we'll give a shadow opacity of 0.1 theory called the Shadow a house is what is used to kind of

03:44.500 --> 03:50.950
give darkness or kind of light opacity is really about making a component or an item see through.

03:50.980 --> 03:57.360
So to speak by applying opacity to a very dark color it kind of lightens it up a little bit.

03:57.520 --> 04:02.590
We can go anywhere from zero to one with the opacity giving a point one gives it just kind of a very

04:02.590 --> 04:04.820
nice light gray color to it.

04:06.290 --> 04:13.210
Knacks for the shadow radius will give a to so two pixels for the radius a shattered radius right here

04:13.230 --> 04:18.500
is just like the border radius so that the corners of the shadow around them off nicely.

04:18.650 --> 04:23.030
And this is really important because it's going to map out nicely with the border radius as well.

04:23.030 --> 04:28.480
If we had a border radius of two but then the shadow was like you know had square edges or square corners.

04:28.490 --> 04:29.810
It would just look really goofy.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.510
And so that's why we're assigning a shadow radius here as well.

04:33.510 --> 04:34.940
Next is the elevation.

04:34.940 --> 04:40.700
We'll talk about why we have elevation later on and then we'll give some margin so a margin left to

04:40.700 --> 04:46.350
five a margin right of five and a margin top.

04:48.890 --> 04:56.020
A 10 these margin settings right here behave the exact same way as they do with normal CSX.

04:56.050 --> 05:01.300
They're used to just place some spacing in between components so a margin left in a margin right.

05:01.300 --> 05:07.210
Says a give me some space in gets left and right hand sides of the device in the actual screen and then

05:07.210 --> 05:11.170
the margin top is related to when we show a card in the list.

05:11.170 --> 05:15.520
So if you have some list of cards we want to make sure that there is some reasonable spacing in between

05:15.520 --> 05:19.050
each one so they don't just kind of all stack right on top of each other.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.410
And so that's why we give it a margin top of 10.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.820
Good the last step.

05:23.830 --> 05:28.000
Now we're going to apply this container style to our view tag.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.970
So on that view tag I will say style.

05:30.970 --> 05:33.610
Make sure you do not say styles it's not plural.

05:33.610 --> 05:42.040
Singular here and then into their pastilles Daut container style and all new line the view tag as well

05:43.160 --> 05:44.770
of course something as Slint air.

05:44.770 --> 05:48.220
Here it says Capones should be closing if they don't have any contents.

05:48.250 --> 05:51.880
We actually are going to add some contents in here very shortly in the next section.

05:51.910 --> 05:57.800
So let's take a quick break and talk about exactly how we're going to use a card component like you

05:57.800 --> 06:00.710
know this one right here to wrap some other component.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.860
So let's take a quick quick break and take care of that in the next section.
