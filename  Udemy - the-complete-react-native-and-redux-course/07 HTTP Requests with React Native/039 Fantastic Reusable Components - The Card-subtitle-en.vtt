00:00.810 --> 00:05.920
In the last section we created our album detail component and the purpose of this thing is to show a

00:05.940 --> 00:11.160
nice looking summary of a single album something like I don't know la.

00:11.340 --> 00:11.940
That right there.

00:11.940 --> 00:12.450
Exactly.

00:12.450 --> 00:18.810
So the album name the artist name some artwork cover image thing and then the buy now button at the

00:18.810 --> 00:19.160
bottom.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.190
So this is the intent.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.620
This is what we're going towards.

00:21.930 --> 00:26.820
So before we get started on this I want to kind of come up with a game plan on exactly how we're going

00:26.820 --> 00:29.930
to design and build this component right here.

00:29.970 --> 00:34.910
There's two different and distinct methodologies that we can take for building this first.

00:34.920 --> 00:41.670
We might make a single kind of make a component something that's going to in one component render this

00:41.670 --> 00:43.200
entire card right here.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.060
So we might end up with some GSX that looks like this right here on the right hand side will have this

00:48.060 --> 00:51.590
kind of a top level view for the overall car.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.490
You know like the border that really goes along the outside.

00:54.870 --> 00:59.740
And then we'll have three blocks inside of that one for each section.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.080
Inside the cart.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.490
And the purpose of this view and right here that's going to contain the image and to text things.

01:07.530 --> 01:12.150
The purpose of this view right here will have some nice styling to make sure there's kind of like you

01:12.270 --> 01:19.180
know margin between the tax and some nice like border here at the bottom between the image and the header.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.030
And this view same thing will have like a nice border and blah blah blah and I sporter on there.

01:24.150 --> 01:28.670
So I have one single make component that has all these different things to it.

01:28.680 --> 01:35.550
And most importantly has all the styling associated with the overall card inside of the single single

01:35.550 --> 01:36.140
component.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.000
So that's that is approach number one.

01:38.010 --> 01:41.000
And that is one direction we can go now.

01:41.070 --> 01:46.590
An alternative layout that we can take something that's just a little bit different and I know this

01:46.590 --> 01:52.230
looks nearly identical but there is a very subtle difference one different approach we can take is to

01:52.230 --> 01:57.920
make two reusable components that will we will to use inside of the album detail.

01:57.930 --> 02:05.490
So the two reusable components will make our the card component and the card item component or a card

02:05.490 --> 02:08.830
section that might be a reasonable name as well.

02:08.880 --> 02:15.990
The purpose of the card and card section components will be to just have some amount of just a component

02:15.990 --> 02:18.810
that has some amount of built in styling.

02:18.810 --> 02:23.150
So we will have styling that has the nice border that goes along outside.

02:23.370 --> 02:27.360
It will have some nice margin to fit the content inside of it.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.340
And basically you get the idea it's going to have some nice styling that we are not going to locate

02:32.640 --> 02:36.060
inside of the album detail component that you've already created.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.500
Now why might we do this.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.570
Why might we take this approach.

02:40.200 --> 02:47.640
Well pretty much for what I just said we'll have separate files the card and the card item that we'll

02:47.940 --> 02:50.630
just know how to show some amount of content inside of it.

02:50.640 --> 02:56.490
But most importantly it will be a reusable component that will have really nice styling associate with

02:56.490 --> 02:56.630
it.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.220
So if we were writing genius or excuse me if we were writing vanilla each team Ellen CSSA here this

03:02.220 --> 03:05.570
might be just like a very fancy div or something like that.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.770
Then we can swap out different detail in the future like you know a different image different button

03:11.070 --> 03:14.630
and still have a nice Like card thing that looks really good.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.500
So I think that is the direction that we want to go.

03:17.520 --> 03:24.480
I want to make a part a component and a card item or we might collect cards section that will both be

03:24.480 --> 03:26.500
reusable and all we're going to do.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.080
They're not going to be any fancy logic inside in anything like that.

03:30.120 --> 03:35.430
The only purpose of the card and the card item is to have some nice styling associated with putting

03:35.430 --> 03:36.760
this card together here.

03:36.810 --> 03:41.610
So if this sounds a little bit strange like Stephen why are we making these extra components.

03:41.610 --> 03:42.860
What is the point this.

03:43.020 --> 03:47.970
Trust me once we start putting the styling together once you see the amount of styling it takes to get

03:47.970 --> 03:50.530
something that looks good you're going to say okay.

03:50.550 --> 03:51.580
Yup.

03:51.630 --> 03:52.280
Good idea.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.770
Like making this reusable is a fantastic idea.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.970
So we don't have to rewrite all these styling rules again in the future.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.530
That is the whole idea here.

03:59.550 --> 04:03.240
I want to just save out on the amount of styling we have to write.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.190
So let's get started on these and this section.

04:06.210 --> 04:11.490
You know let's let's start building this card component and this card item and I really don't like the

04:11.490 --> 04:14.720
name card item I think we might rename it to parts section.

04:14.730 --> 04:15.280
We'll see.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.810
We'll see what happens.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.680
Anyways let's get started by making the card component.

04:20.760 --> 04:27.390
So again a new component means a new file inside of my components directory or make a new file called

04:27.450 --> 04:29.470
simply Carr-Gomm.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.070
Yes.

04:31.200 --> 04:39.420
And then inside of here we'll put together our usual boiler plate I will import re-act from react.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.740
I don't want to import either.

04:41.760 --> 04:49.540
I just want to view so import view from re-act native and let's do Konst card

04:52.620 --> 04:59.900
and right now will just return a new tack and I'm going to leave it open.

04:59.910 --> 05:05.550
So we will get a yes lent air here about a million to self-closing but that's OK we're going to fill

05:05.550 --> 05:08.270
something in here in just a while at the bottom.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.970
We'll do our expert default card.

05:11.690 --> 05:12.180
Cool.

05:12.270 --> 05:12.580
OK.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.400
So again just to be clear.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.260
The sole purpose of this component right here is just to make something with some nice styling that

05:19.260 --> 05:20.450
looks like a card.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.540
So that's all we're going to be focusing on.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.770
Let's continue with this in the next section
