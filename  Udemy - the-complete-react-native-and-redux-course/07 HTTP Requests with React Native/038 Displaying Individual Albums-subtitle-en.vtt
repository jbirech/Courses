00:00.900 --> 00:06.090
We've now got our list of that is rendered on screen all the albums we got back from the adjacent endpoint

00:06.390 --> 00:11.400
but we did get a little bit of a worry message down here something about a key property.

00:11.400 --> 00:16.580
So this is a little bit of a gotcha with react whenever we show components that are in an array.

00:16.650 --> 00:21.270
And that is exactly what we're doing here with the render Haldane's method we are producing an array

00:21.570 --> 00:28.680
and rendering it inside of our GSX here each property or that each component inside of that array must

00:28.680 --> 00:31.370
have a key property associated with it.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.560
The whole purpose of this is just for performance concerns.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.530
It's how re-act make sure that as it renders a list of components it is intelligently listing a or sees

00:40.530 --> 00:44.040
me rendering or updating a very particular component.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.870
So to fix it I place my GSX on a new line just to get myself a little bit of space.

00:51.720 --> 00:58.830
And then inside of the text tag I'm going to add on a key property and the key property here is what

00:58.830 --> 01:02.310
re-act is going to use to figure out which item in the list.

01:02.310 --> 01:04.210
It is updating at any given time.

01:04.380 --> 01:10.800
So the only requirement of this key property is that it must be unique against all of the other elements

01:10.800 --> 01:11.630
in the array.

01:11.640 --> 01:17.460
And number two we also must make sure that it is the same value across rebounders renders the list.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.070
So a common mistake to make is to say oh well I'll just use the index of this album with in the array

01:23.460 --> 01:27.680
that is not something that's guaranteed to be consistent across three renderers.

01:27.690 --> 01:33.360
And so it's not really appropriate for use as a key in this case we're working with the list of albums

01:33.720 --> 01:38.430
each title is actually kind of sufficiently randomized or axis to be unique.

01:38.460 --> 01:44.040
So I will use a key of the album's title on actual applications.

01:44.040 --> 01:50.100
By far the best property used for a key is if your resource has an ID associated with it and you can

01:50.100 --> 01:53.530
just use a key of the records ID right here.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.100
In this case our Allans do not have an ID so we don't get the benefit of that.

01:58.110 --> 02:03.030
All right let's refresh and it looks like the airwing way.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.410
So everything is fantastic now.

02:05.910 --> 02:11.760
So back to what we were working on right now we have the name property or excuse me title property of

02:11.790 --> 02:16.020
each album display and with that you know not too useful not at all.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.780
We want to see a lot more detail related to each album.

02:19.830 --> 02:26.520
So as I mentioned previously we will create a new component called album detail and album detail is

02:26.520 --> 02:32.790
going to take one album as a prop or property and it's going to render a lot of information about that

02:32.790 --> 02:33.850
single album.

02:34.080 --> 02:38.940
So in this section we're going to start working on this new album detail component.

02:39.070 --> 02:44.980
Remember the process we go through each time we make a new component we make a new file.

02:45.210 --> 02:51.820
So in my component's directory I will make a new file and I'm going to call it album detail.

02:51.990 --> 02:53.160
Yes.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.560
And then inside of here we will put down our boiler plate.

02:58.680 --> 03:09.430
So I will import re-act from react and I will import both view and text from re-act native.

03:09.450 --> 03:13.880
Now this is something we're going to start asking you had a time when every start creating a component

03:13.950 --> 03:19.560
whether or not this needs to be a class based component or a functional component.

03:19.560 --> 03:24.780
In this case for the album detail we have something that is just showing some data to the user.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.870
It is solely a presentational component.

03:27.870 --> 03:33.360
And so I think that this can stand to be just a functional component because we do not need lifecycle

03:33.360 --> 03:36.410
methods and we do not need to get access to state.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.150
So I will define my functional component

03:43.120 --> 03:46.240
and then I will export it as by default

03:49.000 --> 03:53.300
go it's now the last thing I want to do before we go too far here.

03:53.350 --> 03:56.550
I want to go back to my album list and just import over there.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.400
So we've got it nice and ready to make use of.

03:59.410 --> 04:06.450
So back inside of album list I will import the album detail.

04:06.700 --> 04:11.400
And now we need to consider what the rules are you see me what the relative path to that file is.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.210
What's in the same directory this time album list is in the same directory as album detail.

04:16.330 --> 04:28.000
So I will say in the current directory slash give me album detail go finally inside of render albums

04:28.000 --> 04:28.710
right here.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.470
I don't really want to be showing any text anymore.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.830
I want to show in album detail.

04:35.050 --> 04:40.030
So I'm going to replace the text tag with album detail

04:42.800 --> 04:43.850
like so.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.730
OK so this is looking good.

04:45.770 --> 04:48.610
But now let's consider it kind of like the next challenge here.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.340
I am showing many album details.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.310
I want to show one album detail per album.

04:54.470 --> 05:03.490
That means I need to somehow communicate somehow communicate from this parent component album list down

05:03.490 --> 05:04.840
into the child component.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.090
The album detail.

05:06.290 --> 05:13.150
Hey I want you to show this very particular album that I like to do some communication there.

05:13.250 --> 05:20.460
So if you recall to do communication from a parent to a child we make use of the props system and react.

05:20.540 --> 05:29.060
So I want to pass the album down to album detail as a prop so no longer do I want to try to show any

05:29.120 --> 05:37.040
album title here because this is no longer text and song and I'd take that out now that I am not passing

05:37.040 --> 05:42.240
in any text and hearing that I should be making this a self-closing component.

05:42.290 --> 05:48.100
So I'm going to remove the closing tag over here and I'm going to make this into a self-closing component

05:48.530 --> 05:52.560
by adding in a forward slash right before the closing bracket.

05:52.580 --> 06:00.200
Finally I need to pass down this album as a prop 2 album detail and to pass it down as a prop so whenever

06:00.260 --> 06:10.400
I want to pass the prop I'll write out the name of the prop equals and then inside of braces I will

06:10.400 --> 06:13.140
list the variables I want to pass down to the child.

06:13.310 --> 06:17.960
So album is album now on inside of the album detail.

06:18.050 --> 06:23.710
I will have a prop of props Daut album and that will be equal to my album.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.380
One thing I want to point out in great detail here.

06:26.390 --> 06:32.210
I'm going to point out several times is not the name of the props very much like the name of the state

06:32.210 --> 06:36.000
that we were working with earlier is completely arbitrary.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.000
I do not have to call this thing right here.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.990
I do not have to call this album just because the variable is also called album.

06:41.990 --> 06:46.290
There is absolutely no tie between the property name and the variable.

06:46.370 --> 06:52.080
So this instead of album I could call it like record and now inside of album detail I would refer to

06:52.130 --> 06:53.570
props not record.

06:53.570 --> 06:56.450
Or it can be prog could be like data.

06:56.450 --> 07:01.760
I don't know anything we want so just to make sure that its really clear the name of the variable up

07:01.760 --> 07:06.380
here does not have to match the name of the prop it just ever so happens that with a lot of the code

07:06.380 --> 07:11.230
that I write they generally end up as being the same good.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.900
So this is looking pretty darn good.

07:14.120 --> 07:20.340
I think that in this component album list we are no longer making use of the text tag anymore up top

07:20.620 --> 07:26.030
so I'm going to remove that text tag just to keep our imports nice and clean make sure we're not importing

07:26.030 --> 07:31.920
anything that we don't need then just to make sure that everything works ok.

07:32.050 --> 07:36.960
You know flip back over to the album detail and let us consume that prop that we just added.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.370
Let's make sure that we're actually making use of that album.

07:40.820 --> 07:48.290
So inside of my album detail component I'm going to return some amount of GSX I I suggest you return

07:49.010 --> 07:54.340
a view tag and it's cited that also some text.

07:54.770 --> 08:00.800
So I want to show again just to keep like you know the implementation we had before without the album

08:00.800 --> 08:07.310
detail equal to what it is now with the album detail on show just like the name or the title of the

08:07.310 --> 08:08.410
album.

08:08.510 --> 08:15.260
So I need to receive the prop that we passed down from album list inside of album detail so I'm going

08:15.260 --> 08:19.760
to receive my props object on that props object.

08:19.760 --> 08:29.030
I will have access to prop's album title and remember it is specifically album that I'm making reference

08:29.030 --> 08:36.200
to here because inside of album list when I rendered the album detail I said hey pass down this thing

08:36.230 --> 08:39.260
as a prop called album.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.660
All right.

08:40.940 --> 08:45.710
So this is looking pretty good at the only warning we have here again is because I've been returning

08:45.710 --> 08:50.300
some amount of JSA are all I'm doing out of this federal function is returning something so it's saying

08:50.630 --> 08:55.970
hey if you're just returning something don't use the curly braces with the return key word again purely

08:55.970 --> 08:57.440
stylistic.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.460
We are going to add in some other code inside of here and in the future section.

09:01.460 --> 09:05.180
So right now I'm just going to kind of leave it as it is.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.860
Let's refresh our simulator and make sure everything is still working.

09:08.990 --> 09:15.590
So refresh the simulator and yet we still got our list of albums appearing on the screen so it looks

09:15.590 --> 09:16.300
perfect.

09:16.340 --> 09:23.330
We have now refactored our text tag inside of the album list to instead use this album detailer component.

09:23.720 --> 09:29.420
Let's get to the next section and focus on making this album detail look a lot better than how it already

09:29.420 --> 09:30.220
looks.
