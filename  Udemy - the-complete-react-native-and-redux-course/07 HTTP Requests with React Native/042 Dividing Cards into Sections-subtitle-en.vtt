00:00.720 --> 00:05.350
In the last section we use a little bit of a trick to make the card component into something really

00:05.350 --> 00:09.390
reusable first inside of our album detail component.

00:09.390 --> 00:11.320
So here is our album detail.

00:11.460 --> 00:16.610
We passed the text tag as a component to the card component that we wrote.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.060
So we passed it inside of the card tag.

00:19.410 --> 00:25.340
Next inside of the card component we took our props object and then we added in reference to prop stock.

00:25.340 --> 00:32.220
Children inside of our GSX because we added our children are component that we had inside of Oulton

00:32.220 --> 00:36.310
detail automatically showed what we passed to the card detail a component.

00:36.330 --> 00:40.890
So I don't use the word component I'm just throwing around like candy over here but I hope you get the

00:40.890 --> 00:41.310
idea.

00:41.310 --> 00:47.250
Basically if we pass one component to another it will show up in the parent as props not children.

00:47.250 --> 00:54.330
So we just have to provide a reference to Propst children somewhere and Boomer good to go also a little

00:54.330 --> 00:57.710
bit more importantly we definitely got our card company up on the screen.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.360
So that is fantastic.

00:59.370 --> 01:05.280
We're going to move ahead now onto our next component which will be the card item component.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.400
So the whole job of this thing is to make sure that we have some distinct sections within the card that

01:11.400 --> 01:14.890
make it you know just look a little bit better than what we've got right now.

01:14.940 --> 01:20.550
Certainly if we had just text inside of this card item I would at least expect it to be better formatted

01:20.550 --> 01:21.830
than what we've got right here.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.390
So that's the purpose of the card item.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.590
Again you know I had mentioned a couple of seconds ago that we might rename this thing the card section.

01:29.710 --> 01:33.570
I don't I don't know what it is but I just feel like I'd be a little bit happier if I called this the

01:33.600 --> 01:34.730
card section.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.990
There's absolutely no reason to go one way or the other.

01:36.990 --> 01:40.330
This is solely personal preference.

01:40.590 --> 01:46.470
So let's create this new card section component inside of our components directory or make a new file

01:47.010 --> 01:50.400
called card section.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.170
Yes.

01:52.260 --> 01:55.150
I mean inside if you're We will throw in our boilerplate.

01:55.170 --> 02:06.480
So import re-act from re-act import our view tag from re-act native and then we need to create our component.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.510
And again we have to ask ourselves as is our standard strategy right now.

02:10.650 --> 02:14.080
Should this be a class based or a functional component.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.160
So just like the card this is solely something that is going to show some you know basically a presentational

02:20.160 --> 02:22.630
component just showing some information to the user.

02:22.740 --> 02:29.040
It doesn't need to have any lifecycle events or any data fetching anything like that doesn't need access

02:29.040 --> 02:29.830
to state.

02:29.850 --> 02:36.360
So I think we're good to go with making this a functional component so we'll make our cards section

02:36.360 --> 02:47.670
component by default it will return a view tag and at the bottom ladder export statement.

02:47.810 --> 02:50.120
So there is our export statement at the bottom.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.420
Cool.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.310
So again this is just like our card component.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.520
It is primarily going to be used for some styling.

02:57.530 --> 03:05.420
So again we'll start off with adding some styling say Konst container style excuse me style.

03:05.450 --> 03:10.900
So here's our style object in the lab a container style to it.

03:11.450 --> 03:18.320
And again inside of here we'll pass in some styling definitely fewer fewer rules this time around.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.400
So not quite as much typing but definitely still a few.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.510
First off we'll put on our border bottom with one.

03:26.540 --> 03:32.750
So if you call back inside of our car component we specifically said I want a border bottom with zero.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.470
You know we like turn the thing off.

03:34.580 --> 03:39.340
And the reason for that was that our current component is going to have a lot of these card sections.

03:39.440 --> 03:45.680
So if we had a card section inside here and we had both a border bottom on the card section and the

03:45.680 --> 03:51.920
card we would be doubling up on the borders on the bottom but still we do have to have a border bottom

03:51.920 --> 03:58.070
on every card section to handle the case in which we've got you know maybe a single card section up

03:58.070 --> 03:58.570
here.

03:58.790 --> 04:01.810
This thing definitely still needs to have a border on the bottom of it.

04:02.090 --> 04:08.360
So this whole border bottom thing is just to reconcile the issue between either a card or a card section

04:08.380 --> 04:10.880
and having the border on the bottom.

04:10.970 --> 04:13.470
Next we'll give it a padding of five.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.110
This is just going to provide a little bit of spacing between whatever's inside the card section and

04:18.110 --> 04:19.790
the border around it.

04:19.790 --> 04:25.660
Next a background color and we're going to be very specific about the color that we want to so.

04:26.210 --> 04:33.250
And then we will add in some justified content rules or I should say fluxbox rules.

04:33.380 --> 04:39.170
So I don't want to talk too much exactly about the purpose of these particular to flex box rules that

04:39.170 --> 04:40.440
we're using right now.

04:40.460 --> 04:45.320
We are going to come back a little bit later and talk about exactly why we're specifically specifying

04:45.410 --> 04:52.480
like star and also in a line or sees me a flex direction of road.

04:52.550 --> 04:58.640
So again we will come back and discuss why we are adding on this flex direction property here and we'll

04:58.640 --> 05:02.580
do a border color of DDD.

05:03.650 --> 05:06.310
And I'm also going to give it a position of relative.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.730
And again I'm sorry one more property where we're just going to have to throw it on here and we're going

05:10.730 --> 05:13.800
to come back and talk why riding on relative later on.

05:14.320 --> 05:14.640
OK.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.550
So that's it for our styling this time round.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.200
Again I encourage you to maybe pause the video really quick and just double check your spelling and

05:21.200 --> 05:22.840
all these property names.

05:24.250 --> 05:28.060
After that we will add that style object to our view tag.

05:28.060 --> 05:33.860
So we'll say style should come from Styles dot container style.

05:34.420 --> 05:40.060
And you'll notice each slant has very helpfully let me know that I made a little bit of a typo.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.730
I really want this object in the bottom to be Stiles not just style.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.750
So I rename it to styles and we should be good to go.

05:46.970 --> 05:47.830
Good.

05:48.310 --> 05:48.550
All right.

05:48.550 --> 05:52.260
So just like the last component we made just like the card component.

05:52.360 --> 05:59.320
We also want this card section to contain some child components that we decide what they are on the

05:59.320 --> 06:00.070
fly right.

06:00.070 --> 06:00.680
For the header.

06:00.700 --> 06:06.520
I want to be an image and some text inside of the center section.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.780
I want to have an image.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.480
And at the bottom I want ampacity a button of sorts.

06:10.480 --> 06:17.470
So again we need to use that props dot children reference inside of this component so the cardstock

06:17.530 --> 06:21.290
section component will add on a reference to the props argument.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.980
And then inside of the view tag we will place props.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.330
Children.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.510
Awesome.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.000
OK.

06:30.030 --> 06:34.140
So let's give this thing a shot to make use of the card section.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.830
We will go over to all of them detail.

06:36.930 --> 06:43.200
So the thought process here is that inside of album detail we've got our card elements and we're going

06:43.200 --> 06:48.870
to give it a couple of different parts sections as well so we can add in immediately a card section

06:48.870 --> 06:51.450
to How's the text that we've got right here.

06:51.450 --> 07:01.390
So we will import a card section from card section and then we will wrap our existing text tag with

07:01.390 --> 07:08.700
the card section component so card section is going to wrap our text tag

07:11.730 --> 07:13.290
like so.

07:13.610 --> 07:20.870
And I think there were definitely had a good place to do a little test for our simulator so let's look

07:20.870 --> 07:22.250
over the simulator.

07:22.260 --> 07:23.540
All refresh it.

07:28.150 --> 07:29.380
And all right.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.770
This is definitely a little bit of an improvement here.

07:31.770 --> 07:34.720
We have some definite padding around each element.

07:34.980 --> 07:39.620
And you can see that now we've got a little bit more distinct bottom border on the section as well.

07:39.700 --> 07:47.070
If we wanted to just for fun I might copy and paste this card section to duplicate it.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.890
It's all just duplicate this thing.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.580
And let's see how it looks when we have multiple card sections.

07:53.320 --> 07:53.790
All right.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.010
So now you see the purpose of the card section.

07:56.050 --> 08:01.270
The purpose of the card section is just to make sure that we've got a nice little compact area within

08:01.270 --> 08:04.770
the card where we can add some content and be happy about it.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.690
So it's definitely starting to look good.

08:06.700 --> 08:12.130
We do not want to have the doubled up card section of course I'm just going to delete that but definitely

08:12.130 --> 08:15.590
our app is definitely Or it's really started come together on the styling side.

08:15.670 --> 08:21.400
So let's continue the next section and add a little bit more detail inside of our album detail a component
