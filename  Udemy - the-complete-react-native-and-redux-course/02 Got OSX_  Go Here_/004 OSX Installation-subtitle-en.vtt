00:00.810 --> 00:06.150
In this section we're going to walk through installation of re-act native on OSX.

00:06.150 --> 00:12.480
So if you are not on a Mac or you do not want to install Iowas specifically if you instead want to go

00:12.480 --> 00:17.880
with Android you'll want to jump to the next section where we'll talk about the installation of Android

00:18.210 --> 00:21.150
on either OSX or on Windows.

00:21.150 --> 00:25.800
So just make sure that you're in the right place and you go to at least one of these set up tracks just

00:25.800 --> 00:27.470
one of them.

00:27.540 --> 00:33.600
So the setup that we're going to go through inside this section for Iowa on OSX is going to be identical

00:33.660 --> 00:40.040
nearly identical to the installation directions that are provided in the official re-act native documentation.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.370
Let's pull that documentation up.

00:41.370 --> 00:49.310
Just a start in my browser to make a new tab and search for reac native and I'll click on the Getting

00:49.310 --> 00:50.700
Started the link right here.

00:52.140 --> 00:58.380
So this is the documentation for getting started with Mack in Iowa s we will go through these instructions

00:58.380 --> 00:58.850
right here.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.860
So if you get lost any point in time you can always come back to these directions.

01:02.910 --> 01:06.570
But I will tell you right now that we're going to go through the set up with a lot more detail than

01:06.570 --> 01:07.830
what's listed right here.

01:07.830 --> 01:13.710
I just want you to know that these directions do exist so let's get started with the setup.

01:13.850 --> 01:19.280
I want you to know right now and this is going to hold true throughout the entire course with any tutorial

01:19.280 --> 01:19.750
I write.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.280
It is very important to me that you understand exactly why we are installing each tool and why we were

01:25.280 --> 01:26.000
left right.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.310
Each line of code.

01:27.530 --> 01:31.850
So before we started doing that installation we're going to just have a very quick discussion about

01:31.850 --> 01:37.550
the purpose of each of these dependencies and exactly what we are installing.

01:37.550 --> 01:43.760
The first dependency that we're going to install is X code x code is Apple's official ID for building

01:43.760 --> 01:50.430
software for nearly any official Apple device like iPhones eye watches or Mac laptops.

01:50.500 --> 01:57.020
We will be using X code to build our apps and install them on a mobile device X code also comes bundled

01:57.020 --> 02:03.550
with the iOS simulator which is a tool used to run mobile apps directly on your desktop or laptop.

02:03.560 --> 02:10.730
Second we'll be installing homebrew homebrew is a Mac OSX dependency management program which we're

02:10.730 --> 02:14.500
going to use for exactly one purpose just to install node.

02:14.790 --> 02:19.250
That's kind of the funny thing about the set up here you have to install programs just to install programs

02:19.290 --> 02:22.560
that kind struck me as all that funny.

02:22.550 --> 02:29.990
Anyways after we install homebrew we'll use it to install node and NPM node and PM are a package deal

02:29.990 --> 02:32.990
sorts then's are installed at the same time.

02:33.260 --> 02:38.360
Knodell we used to run javascript outside the browser which is what we're going to be doing well and

02:38.380 --> 02:41.000
Tim is used for dependency management.

02:41.180 --> 02:47.030
In our case we'll be using node to process some javascript files that will be creating the javascript

02:47.030 --> 02:51.930
that we write will be processed by node and then pumped into our re-act native application.

02:52.010 --> 02:54.710
But we'll talk all about that later on.

02:55.010 --> 02:58.250
Third excuse me fourth we'll be installing Watchmen.

02:58.250 --> 03:02.530
Watchmen is a program developed by Facebook for exactly one purpose.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.570
Watching files are a hard drive and noticing when they get changed Watchmen will be used by re-act native

03:08.570 --> 03:15.560
to automatically process changes to our code base and update the mobile app that we're working on.

03:15.560 --> 03:19.560
In practice we don't actually have to do anything with watchman besides install it.

03:19.970 --> 03:24.590
The Riak native package that irks me the native command line tool will take care of everything from

03:24.590 --> 03:25.370
there.

03:25.370 --> 03:30.380
Speaking of which the last thing that will install is the re-act native command line interface.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.520
This has two purposes.

03:31.520 --> 03:37.820
The first of which is to generate new reac native projects and the second is to run our projects in

03:37.940 --> 03:39.790
either the Iowa us or I.

03:39.870 --> 03:43.160
You mean iOS or Android simulator.

03:43.430 --> 03:44.900
So that's the purpose of each piece here.

03:44.930 --> 03:47.910
Couple of different items to install and we're going to get started right now.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.370
First with X code.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.840
So we're going to start off with installing X code and then we'll continue in the next section with

03:53.840 --> 03:56.150
everything else to try and solve as well.

03:56.510 --> 04:01.670
Let me tell you right now one thing about X code very important remark even if you already have X code

04:01.670 --> 04:08.090
installed I beg you please please please go through the x code installation process and make sure that

04:08.090 --> 04:10.590
you do not have any pending updates.

04:10.700 --> 04:15.350
And the words make sure you have the latest version of X code you would not believe the number of problems

04:15.350 --> 04:20.330
I have troubleshot that were caused by out of out of date versions of X code.

04:20.330 --> 04:24.160
So it's just as really low hanging fruit if you just do the update right now.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.390
You'll be good to go.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.940
So let's walk through the installation process.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.070
I'm going to first open up the app store.

04:31.240 --> 04:36.170
So I to hit command space to bring up the spotlight search and then look for AppStore

04:39.570 --> 04:44.520
the app store is kind of notoriously slow but once it actually boots up on the top right hand side I

04:44.520 --> 04:53.170
will search for X code and then we'll get our search results eventually.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.660
You know eventually.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.630
All right there we go.

04:55.860 --> 05:03.860
And on the very top left I have the X code result so opened up X code and I've already got X could installed

05:03.870 --> 05:04.850
myself.

05:04.860 --> 05:08.580
But go ahead if you do not have it installed this button will be green.

05:08.610 --> 05:14.130
Click install and go through the installation process like one or two windows will pop up and say hey

05:14.130 --> 05:17.930
you know except the license agreement or what have you.

05:17.930 --> 05:21.760
Just click accept accept and it will install X code for you.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.390
If you already have X code installed.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.840
So really important if you already have X code installed.

05:26.850 --> 05:33.330
Again I beg you please come up here to the top right to the Updates tab and just verify that you have

05:33.330 --> 05:35.480
the latest version of X code.

05:35.940 --> 05:38.520
Once it find there you go.

05:38.760 --> 05:43.980
So you can see that you know I've installed X code update couple of days ago version 7.3.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.410
If you have a newer version no problem whatsoever.

05:46.410 --> 05:50.260
Just make sure that you've got the lase latest version of Mexico installed.

05:50.400 --> 05:50.660
OK.

05:50.670 --> 05:51.260
So that's it.

05:51.280 --> 05:51.860
That's good.

05:51.870 --> 05:52.880
In a nutshell.

05:53.130 --> 05:56.100
If you are going through the installation right now continue with that.

05:56.100 --> 06:00.870
We're going to take a quick break and then come back in the next section and start walking through our

06:00.920 --> 06:02.280
node installation.
