WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.370
In the last section we got started with our X code installation and now we're going to continue with

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.880
everything else starting with homebrew.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.840
So homebrew again is used to install Nood.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.330
That's all we're going to use it for homebrew is also used to install many other OS X programs.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.030
You may already have it installed.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.750
If you do not.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.570
No problem.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.430
We're going to install it right now.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.590
So I going to open up my browser and we're going to navigate directly to brew dot SH

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.280
once it Brooky.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.550
SH There's a fantastic link right in the middle here.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.840
Big text box.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.140
We're going to highlight everything inside of your skin and highlight all of it and I will copy it and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.360
then we're going to execute this script at our command line that script right there will automatically

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.290
install and configure homebrewed for us.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150
So I'll flip over to my terminal.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.620
I've already got my terminal open.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.300
If you do not have your eyes open you can open it right now by just running terminal like so.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.310
Once my terminal is open I'm going to paste that link in here and make sure that I've got the entire

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.230
length series from user been all the way through the ending quotes with install over here.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.460
And then I will simply run it to install it.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.830
In my case I've already got homebrew installed so everything is good to go.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.130
If you already have homebrew installed you can update it by running through updates.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
And this will run through and install a bunch of or excuse me update your listing of all dependencies

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.340
and packages.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.930
Who has access to.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
Is usually takes like a min or two to run.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.590
Will give it another second and then I'll just there we go.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.660
Hopefully yours runs a little bit faster than mine.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.980
I'm not on the fastest Internet connection here but no problem.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.580
Well while that runs will go ahead and go through the node installation as well.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.240
So I'm going to begin at the command line run the command Brue install node and this is all it takes

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.040
to install no.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.120
Yes in my case I'm already running that update.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.990
In addition I actually already have Mode installed right now version 6.3.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.330
If you have an earlier version of node no problem no problem whatsoever.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.790
Just make sure that you have at least a version 4.5.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.580
That's kind of like the minimum cut off re-act native right now at least make sure the 4.5 this installation

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.250
might take you a minute or two to run through so no problem.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.380
If you want to pause the video right now and let the installation finish up fantastic.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.460
Once the installation is complete I'm going to confirm that node is installed by at the command line

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.090
running node dash V and when I run that you can see I get my version Pop up so fantastic that means

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.840
everything's installed on raid to use mode.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.710
I can now also install the watchman program as well so I will run Brue install Watchmen.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.290
I remember is a program developed by Facebook for just watching our hard drive for file changes.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.280
That's all we're using it for.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.910
So I will install Watchmen.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
In my case again I think I've already got installed as you see right here.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.010
If you don't have install just go ahead and again let it do its thing and only take a minute or two

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.510
to get set up.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.270
Then the very last thing that we need to install will be the re-act native CLID at the command line

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.750
again.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.930
I will run NPM install Dasch G re-act native Seelye and make sure you got the dashes in between each

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.200
of those.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.560
In my case again for the fourth time in a row I've already got this installed so it's either going to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.080
decide to try to do an update or just say hey you already got this going.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.040
OK.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.280
Looks like it just went ahead and did an update perhaps.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.580
So that's it.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.930
That's all we need to get started with Riak need of a lie at this point in time.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.350
We're now going to use re-act need of Selye to generate our first project.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.480
Once you generate a Riak need a project it really takes a minute to go through the installation.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.720
It downloads a lot of dependencies and does a lot of project setup.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.450
So when we generate this project this first one we're going to get started with.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.630
It's to taking a little bit of time to run through.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.820
We'll take a quick break and then continue development in the next section so let's get started with

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.820
this startup process.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.250
I'm in a directory right now where I want to place my project.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.430
So if you're not in a good project directory a good place to try to place it.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.850
You'll want to change a directory for me right now I'm in a nice place called workspace workspace Prod.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.260
which is for me short for production it means this is the code that I'm going to be writing for the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.850
course and you know what I can kind of stuff.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.060
Anyways the point is that I'm in a great spot right here to get started at the project so we're going

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.710
to generate our first project by running the command line interface.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.780
We'll type in re-act native init albums re-act native is a reference to the Riak native command line

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.390
tool.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.080
Init means we want to initialize a new project and then the last term here albums is the name of the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.910
first application that we're going to build.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.650
So the name of this application is going to be albums.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.430
So let's go ahead and run this.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.800
Again this is going to take some amount of time to get through.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.690
So I'm going to pause the video right now and will continue in a little bit by getting started with

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.150
our excellent setup and then we're going to start working on our first application so I will catch you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.290
in the next section.
