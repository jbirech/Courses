00:01.790 --> 00:07.560
In the last section we spoke a little bit about the behavior or the purpose of react as it relates to

00:07.560 --> 00:09.490
rebox and this application we're about to build.

00:09.490 --> 00:15.090
So we're going to treat re-act much more like just layer that produces GSX and content like that's it.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.960
That's all we want react do from now on.

00:16.970 --> 00:21.960
And we're going to depend on redux for handling all the decision making inside our application.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.100
So with that in mind we're going to get started on our log in form in this section.

00:26.190 --> 00:30.900
The first thing we need to do is make sure that we pull over all those default re-usable components

00:30.900 --> 00:33.920
that we've been carting around all over the place.

00:33.930 --> 00:39.990
So again there are fancier ways to do this by using NPM or get some modules but we're going to do it

00:39.990 --> 00:41.220
in the simplest way possible.

00:41.220 --> 00:46.320
We're just going to copy paste a directory full of all those common components.

00:46.470 --> 00:53.340
So inside my source directory I'm going to make a new folder called components and then I'm going to

00:53.340 --> 00:57.050
open up my current directory.

00:57.390 --> 01:04.670
So here is my manager project and I'm also going to open up a second window here just so I can be very

01:04.670 --> 01:06.830
explicit about what's going on.

01:07.550 --> 01:12.630
Let's go over to my workspace.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.890
I'm going to find my last project that I worked on which was the tech stack project.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.990
I mean go in there and find my common directory.

01:22.070 --> 01:25.230
So here's my button card card section blah blah blah.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.550
And I copy this send a copy of a directory and it come over to my manager application and drop it into

01:31.550 --> 01:34.650
the source excuse me in the components directory.

01:34.670 --> 01:36.220
There we go.

01:36.280 --> 01:36.820
There you go.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.960
OK so in component's I've got my common folder and inside of their button card card section voila all

01:41.960 --> 01:44.000
that good stuff.

01:44.030 --> 01:44.470
All right.

01:44.570 --> 01:52.340
So we now got our starter pack of components something to very quickly get start with our application

01:52.430 --> 01:53.850
again with Riak native.

01:54.050 --> 01:58.150
So fantastic to have reusable components like this it really speeds up development.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.050
So let's get started with our log in form.

02:01.070 --> 02:06.880
We're going to create a new folder or a new file inside the components directory called log in form

02:09.320 --> 02:16.490
so because we are going to be making a standalone component this time one that depends way more on redux.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.770
I'm not going to copy paste over my existing log in form.

02:19.880 --> 02:25.000
We're going to do this from scratch and say OK how do we make a log in form that works nicely with redux.

02:25.100 --> 02:31.100
And we're going to kind of you know juxtapose the react based approach with the react with redox approach

02:31.610 --> 02:32.070
instead.

02:32.090 --> 02:36.440
So it's going to you know get a better sense of what the differences difference is between these two

02:36.440 --> 02:38.800
different approaches.

02:38.900 --> 02:46.370
So it's putting in some boilerplate for a log in form at the top will import react and component from

02:46.370 --> 02:53.240
react and we'll get started with just the card component from common.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.320
So one of our common components that will make our log and form

03:00.570 --> 03:07.100
will place our render method and will return a default card component right now.

03:07.540 --> 03:15.900
And at the bottom will export default log and form like so and then just to get something to show up

03:15.900 --> 03:17.860
on the screen of our application.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.640
I'm going to flip back over to the app component.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.840
I'm going to import the log in form at the top

03:27.490 --> 03:33.280
components log and form and I'm going to replace my text tag.

03:33.340 --> 03:41.750
In my view tag inside the render method with this log in form OK so who looks like I got a little typo

03:41.750 --> 03:42.440
on the path there.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.200
So import log in form from components.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.910
That's better.

03:48.080 --> 03:48.390
OK.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.680
So nothing special going on so far.

03:50.690 --> 03:55.370
Again just our very standard boilerplate in here just yet.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.820
Do you take note that I'm not worrying about navigation yet.

03:57.830 --> 04:02.780
So you know there's no concept of showing different content to the user yet we're always going to show

04:02.780 --> 04:06.320
the log in form to them right now.

04:06.320 --> 04:06.640
All right.

04:06.650 --> 04:10.600
So let's do a quick refresh just to make sure that everything is going ok.

04:11.270 --> 04:15.340
Most importantly I want to make sure that we've got those default components over.

04:15.340 --> 04:19.790
It looks I know it's very subtle but we kind of see the border here of the card component so it looks

04:19.790 --> 04:21.390
like we're in a good spot here.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.590
Now let's continue by doing a little more scaffolding out.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.380
I want to create my input tags for my email and password.

04:28.460 --> 04:36.380
So at the top we're going to import our card section our inputs and our button and now we're going to

04:36.380 --> 04:42.280
place our e-mail and put our password input and our button tag as well.

04:43.330 --> 04:50.890
So we'll make a card section we're going to need three of these one for both components and one for

04:50.890 --> 04:53.560
the button song and I copy paste these in as well.

04:53.590 --> 04:57.780
So I got three card sections now and the first of all put our input

05:00.740 --> 05:04.420
for our e-mail.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.060
I'll give it a placeholder.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.210
About e-mail at CNN.com.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.430
That's what we did last time.

05:12.990 --> 05:21.530
Inside the second one the second card section that is we'll place our password so thrown secure tech

05:21.550 --> 05:27.940
century remember this is the prompt to say they make sure that the text in here displays as dots and

05:27.950 --> 05:30.920
give a label of password past board.

05:31.010 --> 05:32.160
That's interesting.

05:32.350 --> 05:37.400
Password a placeholder of password.

05:37.740 --> 05:40.200
And finally we'll do our button

05:42.890 --> 05:44.960
and they'll just have the text log in.

05:45.440 --> 05:45.890
OK.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.500
So good boilerplate good place to start.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.410
Let's do another refresh to make sure that we're going ok so far.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.610
And yup looks good.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.940
We got e-mail password and log in button on the screen.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.420
So notice that so far.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.030
Yes everything looks identical.

05:59.030 --> 06:03.130
We still have to have the inputs we still have that button for all that stuff.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.930
It's still happening on the re-act side.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.440
What's really going to start to change however is the fact that we're not going to have the component

06:09.440 --> 06:12.230
keep track of the value of the email and password.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.790
We're going to have redux be in charge of that instead.

06:15.050 --> 06:19.170
So let's continue the next section and start hooking up redux to this forum.
