00:00.930 --> 00:06.690
Just two more steps to make sure that we get our e-mail input working with redux instead of local component

00:06.690 --> 00:12.330
state the first thing we need to do is make sure that our douceur watches for an action of the appropriate

00:12.330 --> 00:13.080
type.

00:13.080 --> 00:18.570
So right now it's always just passing back state object which right now is just an empty object with

00:18.570 --> 00:19.800
an email property.

00:19.800 --> 00:25.740
We need to make sure that we watch for this action of type email changed and then update our state object

00:25.740 --> 00:27.930
appropriately.

00:27.930 --> 00:33.210
Now let's look over to my auction creator email change so here it is right here I'm inside my actions

00:33.210 --> 00:34.430
index file.

00:34.470 --> 00:40.830
Right now we've got a type of e-mail changed and that type is you know very literally a string as a

00:40.830 --> 00:43.260
string that says email change.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.400
So I want to pause here for a second and point something out to you.

00:46.590 --> 00:54.360
This stream right here is forming an incredibly strong link between this action and to reduce or write

00:54.540 --> 00:59.980
like this string right here this literal string right here we have to reproduce over inside of our douceur

01:00.000 --> 01:04.670
file right here and make sure that there's like no typos in there whatsoever.

01:04.730 --> 01:12.230
And if I end up making a small typo on either side so something like you know email changed or email

01:12.270 --> 01:17.700
change right like it's so easy to make a typo like that what's the difference if I make a typo like

01:17.700 --> 01:24.790
that then my reducer is never going to properly pick up on this action when it's dispatch.

01:24.810 --> 01:31.470
So if I live to solve this issue the convention the redux community is to make variables to hold our

01:31.470 --> 01:32.810
actions tight.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.300
So let's pull up a diagram and check out what the idea behind this is.

01:38.300 --> 01:42.540
OK so we're going to make a new file called types Dot.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.060
Yes.

01:43.090 --> 01:46.810
A new file just called types inside this file.

01:46.810 --> 01:51.530
We're going to make a set of constant variables and assign them a string.

01:51.610 --> 01:59.410
So we will create a variable like capital email changed equals email changed or another one like password

01:59.440 --> 02:02.050
underscored change equals password change.

02:02.050 --> 02:05.400
So these two variable names email change and password change.

02:05.530 --> 02:12.220
And we're going to assign them a string then we are going to import that into both our reducer and our

02:12.220 --> 02:13.210
action.

02:13.210 --> 02:17.850
And we're going to use that variable as opposed to just a raw string.

02:18.640 --> 02:25.030
So the the point here the idea behind this is that we're going to avoid making any very small typo like

02:25.260 --> 02:31.180
you know accidentally dropping off the D or the II or whatever it might be and that literal string that

02:31.180 --> 02:34.550
we're typing out by using a variable instead.

02:34.750 --> 02:40.600
If I reference a variable like email changed like all capitals right here and I say drop off the deep

02:40.690 --> 02:45.730
inside of the action file I'm going to get a big error message that says like hey I got no no no idea

02:45.730 --> 02:47.540
what variable you're referencing here.

02:47.540 --> 02:50.270
Like email change I have no idea what that is.

02:50.470 --> 02:55.740
And so it's a very clear signal to you as the developer that OK you know what I must of made a typo

02:55.770 --> 02:58.430
somewhere in there I need to go fix up my tights.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.190
So let's let's give it a shot.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.510
See how it works in practice.

03:01.630 --> 03:06.520
Honestly it's not the worst thing in the world so let's just kind of blow through it real quickly and

03:06.520 --> 03:08.290
some of my actions folder.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.470
I'm going to make a new file called types.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.470
Yes.

03:12.490 --> 03:16.990
Now inside of here we're going to put all the definitions for all the different types that we're going

03:16.990 --> 03:18.890
to have in our application over time.

03:18.910 --> 03:27.770
So one file all of the actions types than inside of here we will say export Konst email.

03:28.010 --> 03:32.620
Change is a lowercase string email change.

03:32.620 --> 03:36.930
Now one thing that I want to point out to you like really could just be really clear about this.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.940
This string right here does not have to match the variable name.

03:40.960 --> 03:46.630
There is absolutely no tie between the value of the string and the variable name.

03:46.630 --> 03:51.540
This just has to be a string that is unique against all of the other actions we have.

03:51.550 --> 03:55.930
Because remember the only purpose of it is to make sure that we've got some like a little marker on

03:55.930 --> 04:01.420
both the action and the reducer so it can be anything we want by convention I like to make it just the

04:01.420 --> 04:03.390
same as the actions name.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.880
So it really doesn't matter if I use lowercase characters or uppercase.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.640
No big difference there.

04:09.400 --> 04:14.580
All right so now we've got our action type defined We're not going to flip over to my actions file so

04:14.580 --> 04:17.280
I can go to actions index start.

04:17.710 --> 04:22.150
And then at the top we're going to import that action type that we've just created.

04:22.540 --> 04:32.920
So at the top I will import e-mail changed from types and it's in the same directory so I'm going to

04:32.920 --> 04:35.520
do just dot slash types.

04:35.680 --> 04:42.100
Finally instead of the type of just a string right here I will replace this with email.

04:42.170 --> 04:48.740
Change goal looks good just to be really clear about one of the things I get a lot of questions about

04:48.740 --> 04:52.120
this inside of my type's file.

04:52.310 --> 04:55.680
I expect to export many different types from this file.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.400
Right we're going to have like a lot of different types because we're going have a lot of different

04:58.460 --> 04:59.530
actions.

04:59.960 --> 05:05.060
So because I expect to export many different things from here I'm going to make what is called a named

05:05.120 --> 05:06.020
export.

05:06.050 --> 05:08.330
So I you say export Konst.

05:08.450 --> 05:13.700
And then the variable name notice decided to not use the default keyword and I didn't use the default

05:13.700 --> 05:19.580
key word because I expect to export many other types like this from this file.

05:19.580 --> 05:25.070
The flip side of that again is that whenever I import from the types file I have to use the curly braces

05:25.070 --> 05:26.190
to say hey you know what.

05:26.180 --> 05:28.850
There's many different things inside that types file.

05:28.850 --> 05:37.620
I specifically want email changed and I indicate that by using the curly braces all right now the next

05:37.620 --> 05:41.080
thing you need to do is pull this type into our author reducer.

05:41.240 --> 05:46.910
So I'm going to flip over to the author douceur your ideas and at the top we'll import that actions

05:46.920 --> 05:57.070
type so import email changed from type actions types.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.260
And inside the switch statement.

05:59.260 --> 06:04.710
We will now add a new case of email changed.

06:04.860 --> 06:09.720
And then right here is where we'll put our logic to handle this new e-mail that's coming across inside

06:09.720 --> 06:12.510
the action.

06:12.510 --> 06:15.830
One other very common error that oh man.

06:15.900 --> 06:16.750
Let me let me just tell you.

06:16.890 --> 06:23.650
This is by far the most common error that I see in any redux application any question I get like it's

06:23.660 --> 06:28.710
probably a 10 percent chance it's tied to this bug that I'm about to tell you right now.

06:29.380 --> 06:32.820
One thing to be aware of with i named exports like this.

06:32.820 --> 06:38.820
You know what we're using right here is that I can pull in any arbitrary property that I want from this

06:39.210 --> 06:40.680
actions types file right.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.600
I can use something like email changed blah blah blah.

06:43.680 --> 06:50.580
Even if it doesn't exist I can try to import this in no air will be thrown I know arrow will be thrown

06:51.240 --> 06:58.110
the what's going to happen is if I cancel logged this value right here I'm not going to actually run

06:58.110 --> 07:00.520
this code so please do not reproduce this.

07:00.580 --> 07:04.030
If I did a console right here this would come across as undefined.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.000
OK so it come across as undefined.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.850
I'm not going to see an error message and what the result is is that if I then use this like Mystery

07:11.880 --> 07:19.650
undefined type right here inside of my reducer I'm going to essentially have a case of case undefined.

07:19.890 --> 07:26.400
But as we all know every action must have a type of not undefined like it must have a declared type.

07:26.460 --> 07:30.300
And so my action will never catch anything inside the reducer.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.170
So extremely common air that I see all the time.

07:33.180 --> 07:38.730
If you ever come across a situation where you're thinking to yourself you know gee whiz I know I'm calling

07:38.730 --> 07:39.570
the action creator.

07:39.570 --> 07:44.100
I have like you know a console log in there or something but it seems that the reducer is never actually

07:44.100 --> 07:46.020
picking up on this action.

07:46.170 --> 07:51.150
And if you ever say that to yourself the first thing you look at is the import statement up here.

07:51.180 --> 07:56.790
I want to look at this I want you to say OK did I actually define an action of this type up here.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.790
And if he did great it must be something else.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.600
But you know double check and make sure that that action actually exists in a really easy way that you

08:03.600 --> 08:10.530
can troubleshoot that is just at a console log in here and say like you know action a very easy way

08:10.530 --> 08:13.570
to make sure that your actions type is actually properly defined.

08:13.850 --> 08:14.130
OK.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.870
So anyway it's a little bit of a side note there but I know that some number of people will make that

08:18.870 --> 08:24.510
mistake and so I just probably saved some number of you for making a frustrating little little mistake

08:24.510 --> 08:26.730
there so it is worth the time to mention.

08:27.230 --> 08:27.520
OK.

08:27.540 --> 08:33.960
So our reducer is now properly catching on type e-mail changed which means we'll take a quick break

08:34.230 --> 08:39.750
and come back in the next section and figure out how we're going to update our state object inside the

08:39.760 --> 08:41.870
reducer is going to open a big can of worms.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.120
And definitely one of the most important topics in this entire application.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.320
So let's take care of it in the next section.
