00:00.650 --> 00:05.680
OK no more goofing around with set up or theory it's time to start writing some real code.

00:05.940 --> 00:10.920
In the last section we generated a new project using the Riak native see a lie.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.460
I'm now sitting inside of that project directory.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.630
The album structure.

00:14.850 --> 00:18.220
And I'm going to open up my code editor inside of this folder.

00:18.360 --> 00:23.580
So say Adam dot notice if you don't have Adam installed on your system you might not be able to run

00:23.580 --> 00:26.410
that Adam command on the left him.

00:26.420 --> 00:31.350
Now I've see a bunch of different files and folders that were automatically generated for us by the

00:31.350 --> 00:32.710
re-act native Seelye.

00:32.970 --> 00:37.160
Remember this was all created by the react in command.

00:37.770 --> 00:45.030
Notice that there are immediately two folders one named Android and one named iOS by default re-act

00:45.030 --> 00:50.170
native assumes that you will want to run your project on both Android and iOS.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.200
So it sets up tooling to run on either platform right underneath those two.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.260
You'll find a folder named node modules.

00:58.260 --> 01:02.700
This house is a bunch of javascript dependencies for our project.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.700
So if you open up that folder right now you'll see dozens of different folders each of which is a separate

01:08.700 --> 01:14.120
dependency that is being loaded into our codebase underneath these folders.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.970
You'll see a couple different files that are used for configuration.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.560
In general we will be really touching any of these different files.

01:22.380 --> 01:26.850
Then a little bit lower down here towards the bottom you'll find the file that we really want to care

01:26.850 --> 01:30.690
about right now which is the index J.S. file.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.290
This is the root file.

01:32.310 --> 01:35.620
The starting point the entry point of our application.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.780
So when we go to build our app we're going to start adding some code inside of this index not J.S. file.

01:42.780 --> 01:47.560
If we open up that file right now you'll see just a little bit of code inside of it.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.250
Again this is all pre-generated by the re-act native Seelye.

01:51.330 --> 01:57.380
Now I'm a big believer of understanding every last line of code that gets written.

01:57.390 --> 02:02.330
So the first thing that we're going to do here is highlight this code and delete it.

02:02.370 --> 02:05.810
So we're going to rewrite everything inside this file from scratch.

02:05.820 --> 02:11.610
So we really understand what is going into building a re-act native application.

02:11.610 --> 02:12.600
This looks good.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.350
Let's continue from here in the next video.
