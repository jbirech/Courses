00:00.940 --> 00:05.110
In the last section we got our first component to show up on the screen of our device.

00:05.190 --> 00:10.870
So I'm using iOS on Mac right here some using the iPhone simulator.

00:11.040 --> 00:16.020
If you're on Windows I'm developing for Android you'll see this in the Android simulator and as you

00:16.020 --> 00:19.390
can see you know you could kind of see that we got some text right there.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.350
But is does it look pretty ugly.

00:22.350 --> 00:26.760
At least though we got some content to show up on the screen of our device and we've got a better idea

00:26.760 --> 00:32.650
of what the import tags are what a component is and how we actually render to screen of our device.

00:33.090 --> 00:36.230
So we will fix this up in just a second.

00:36.270 --> 00:40.950
But before we do let's talk a little bit about the first application that we're going to be building.

00:41.190 --> 00:44.430
And then we can come back and start to improve how this thing looks right here.

00:44.820 --> 00:52.920
So let's open up a mockup of this first application that will be making this mock up of our app the

00:52.920 --> 00:58.800
app's purpose is going to be to display the user with a number of different music records that they

00:58.800 --> 01:04.890
can purchase like you know I say records I mean like actual CDs at the very top of the app will be a

01:04.890 --> 01:09.190
header that simply says albums which is the name of our application.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.810
Then below the header will be our list of albums right here.

01:12.810 --> 01:17.760
I'm only showing a single one but we should have support for showing many albums that the user can scroll

01:17.760 --> 01:19.330
through.

01:19.560 --> 01:25.740
Each album will be represented by this kind of a big rectangle right here which we refer to as a card

01:26.730 --> 01:31.640
on the header of the card should be a icon of the artist.

01:31.650 --> 01:38.490
So like the singer or whoever created the record it should display the album's name the artist name

01:38.940 --> 01:40.410
all inside the header.

01:40.980 --> 01:47.160
Then in the body of the card which is this big X right here this represents the album image.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.790
So like the actual album artwork it should be a nice very large image right in the center of the card.

01:53.790 --> 02:00.150
Finally at the very bottom of the card should be a button that says by now and whenever a user clicks

02:00.150 --> 02:04.870
this we should direct the user over to a page where they can purchase the album.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.720
So we're not going to be building that actual purchase page we're just going to kick the user over to

02:10.070 --> 02:16.500
an Amazon.com page inside their browser on the device where they can buy that album if they want to.

02:17.250 --> 02:25.170
So again we're going to have many different cards like you know on the card as this whole old unit right

02:25.170 --> 02:26.380
here is trying to say.

02:26.610 --> 02:31.820
And we'll have one unit or one card for each album that we've retrieved or fetched.

02:32.550 --> 02:32.790
OK.

02:32.790 --> 02:37.470
So this is basically the application of rebuilding is our first one and we're going to focus a lot on

02:37.470 --> 02:42.990
just the basics of react and how we use reac native to build an application like this at the start of

02:42.990 --> 02:43.890
each app that we build.

02:43.890 --> 02:48.000
We're also going to spend some amount of time to plan out exactly how we're going to tackle that project

02:48.450 --> 02:49.200
in particular.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.900
We're going to decide what different types of components we want to make.

02:55.020 --> 03:02.800
As a reminder a component is a function that returns some amount of GSX and GSX is what tells reac native

03:02.820 --> 03:07.430
What content we want to show on the screen whenever we build a re-act application.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.500
We attempt to make components that are generally as reusable as possible so we can write one component

03:13.800 --> 03:16.490
and then use it in several different locations throughout our app.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.820
It's all about reuse of code for this application.

03:20.820 --> 03:25.240
We're going to make several different components to build this application.

03:25.830 --> 03:30.130
Here's kind of a diagram of all the different components and what they might be called.

03:30.330 --> 03:35.580
We might make one component called Hetter component that will just sit at the very top of our application

03:36.540 --> 03:38.880
then represent a single album.

03:38.880 --> 03:46.680
We might make a car component so a car component has many card sections inside of it and each card section

03:46.980 --> 03:48.380
will have some amount of content.

03:48.390 --> 03:53.970
So the one at the very top will be you know the actual album or seeing the artist image with the name

03:53.970 --> 03:56.800
of the artist and the album name.

03:56.970 --> 04:01.710
And then another card section that shows the image and then another card section that shows the buy

04:01.710 --> 04:02.880
now button.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.260
In addition we might even make another component just to represent the buy now button.

04:07.260 --> 04:12.000
We'll talk more about all the different considerations of when we want to make a reusable component

04:12.330 --> 04:20.070
versus we want to make like a very kind of one off or custom component as we work throughout this application.

04:20.070 --> 04:25.350
So planning out our Capones ahead of time like this just makes it easier later on to have a very solid

04:25.350 --> 04:30.030
idea of the different parts of the application that we need to focus on when we're building it gives

04:30.440 --> 04:34.820
like it just makes it easier to build the application when we know we want to make ahead of time.

04:35.250 --> 04:35.550
Okay.

04:35.570 --> 04:40.110
So honestly this is a pretty ambitious out to scrotes to start off with but I'm confident that we're

04:40.110 --> 04:44.930
going to work through it and learn just a ton about re-act native along the way.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.230
So let's get started with it in the next section
