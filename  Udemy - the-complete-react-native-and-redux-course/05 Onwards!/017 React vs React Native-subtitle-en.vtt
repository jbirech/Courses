00:00.950 --> 00:06.690
And the last section we started writing out our first component and hit early stumbling block with just

00:06.690 --> 00:12.780
the first two lines of code here we are referencing two separate libraries and we're also doing so with

00:12.870 --> 00:18.990
this strange import syntax and this video we're going to discuss the differences between react and react

00:19.020 --> 00:24.930
native And we're also going to review the import syntax that we are using to pull a library into this

00:24.930 --> 00:26.310
file with.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.820
So I'm going to pull up a diagram the first of many many diagrams that are going to be looking at to

00:32.880 --> 00:37.980
figure out what the difference between the react and then react need of libraries are when we work with

00:37.980 --> 00:44.130
the re-act native application we are interfacing with two separate distinct libraries authored by the

00:44.130 --> 00:49.560
re-act team re-act natives and react again to separate libraries.

00:49.560 --> 00:56.820
Each has its own distinct job re-act library contains a bunch of code that describes how a component

00:56.820 --> 01:03.600
should behave such as what functions it should have and also knows how to deal with a big pile of components

01:03.600 --> 01:06.990
like you know how to take a bunch of components and make them work together.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.160
Like I said earlier we're going to end up making apps with a dozen different components.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.760
And something needs to know how to take all these different things and make them work together.

01:17.790 --> 01:20.860
That is the job of the re-act library.

01:21.060 --> 01:26.910
On the other hand re-act native can be thought of as our portal to the mobile device like the thing

01:26.910 --> 01:32.490
that we can use to get a handle on the mobile device that we're running on it knows how to take output

01:32.490 --> 01:38.820
from a component and make it appear on a mobile device Riak native also provides us with a couple of

01:39.030 --> 01:44.720
primitive components that we can use to show simple text or simple images.

01:45.330 --> 01:49.950
Right now we're not going to sweat the differences between react and react native to much.

01:50.040 --> 01:54.450
I'll be getting a lot of direction on which one of these We're going to be using at any point in time.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.140
And soon you'll know which one to refer to you like second nature.

01:59.180 --> 02:05.400
The next thing I want to talk about is a quicker view of import statements import statements like the

02:05.400 --> 02:12.480
two we have here are part of 6 and you might recall that yes six is a new version of javascript with

02:12.480 --> 02:14.100
E-6 code that we write.

02:14.220 --> 02:20.850
Each file can be thought of as having its own little separate compartment or cell by default.

02:21.270 --> 02:28.260
No file gets access to any global variables or anything like that only by importing libraries into a

02:28.260 --> 02:28.740
file.

02:28.740 --> 02:35.430
Can we reach out to other files and work with code that exists elsewhere in our project.

02:35.430 --> 02:39.720
So with that in mind the two import statements that we have right here start to make a little bit more

02:39.720 --> 02:40.810
sense.

02:40.860 --> 02:47.040
This file that we're working on has no access to like intrinsically any variables within our project

02:47.040 --> 02:52.840
whatsoever any outside code that we want to work with inside this file must be imported.

02:52.840 --> 02:58.680
And so we added one import statement to import the reactor library and the second one to import the

02:58.680 --> 03:00.650
re-act native library.

03:01.410 --> 03:01.770
OK.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.290
So that is I know a lot of discussion for two simple lines of code.

03:05.460 --> 03:10.770
Let's continue to the next section and work on our next step which will need to create our component
