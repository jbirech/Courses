00:01.380 --> 00:06.840
Read a good spot now to move on to working our on our employee list component I would love to start

00:06.840 --> 00:07.730
working on this component.

00:07.740 --> 00:11.520
But you know we don't have the ability to make any employees yet.

00:11.550 --> 00:14.760
So we've got no employee creation whatsoever.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.570
So if we start working on the employee list well you know we're not going to have any data to show it

00:18.570 --> 00:19.530
just yet.

00:19.530 --> 00:24.570
So I can recommend that we do a little bit of a sidestep here and we go work on the employee creation

00:24.570 --> 00:30.240
form give our users the ability to create an employee and then we can come back to working our on our

00:30.240 --> 00:31.510
employee list here.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.190
So that's going to be our asking our plan.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.020
If you recall or Mocca we said that we were going to have a separate screen and right now this is a

00:40.020 --> 00:42.540
little bit disingenuous a little bit misleading.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.240
It's set up to look like the edit or show for a single employee but we definitely have a screen where

00:48.240 --> 00:56.420
we show a name phone and shift field to the users so that they can enter these and create a new employee.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.340
So we're definitely going to need to think about this a little bit.

00:59.340 --> 01:04.830
The big challenge we have to do at the outset is get an ad button up here on the top right hand side

01:04.860 --> 01:06.370
of our employees bar.

01:06.420 --> 01:11.550
So we've already seen that the nav bar can automatically generate a back button for us but now we want

01:11.550 --> 01:16.870
to also somehow get a like you know basically add a record button in there and do something with it

01:18.390 --> 01:23.090
do so we can expand a little bit more on the scene component API.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.770
So I've already pulled a couple of the different API properties for scene you know a couple of different

01:28.770 --> 01:30.100
props out.

01:30.270 --> 01:34.350
So I think that for the next one maybe would be nice if we check out the official docs so I can show

01:34.350 --> 01:39.090
you where you look up all these different props from in my browser.

01:39.090 --> 01:42.150
I've already pulled up the hub repository for the react.

01:42.180 --> 01:49.650
Nate re-act native router flex project Marielle got the first time prescious big enough so I'm going

01:49.650 --> 01:50.820
to scroll down a little bit.

01:50.970 --> 01:56.010
The documentation for this project is I would say a little bit mixed like in some locations.

01:56.010 --> 02:00.950
There's very good API documentation and other locations and it's a little bit lacking.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.840
And we're going to see one lacking areas here in just a second.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.440
That's why I specifically want to show you this.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.670
So I'm on the API and configuration page and you can see that there is a whole bunch of different stuff

02:11.670 --> 02:13.490
that the Leibert gives you access to.

02:13.490 --> 02:19.120
And I've already used the router we use the seen we've used actions.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.860
And hey maybe what we really want here is the nav bar because we want to figure out a way to make the

02:23.860 --> 02:27.840
nav bar show a button on the top right inside that says like at.

02:27.850 --> 02:33.270
So we can go the add new employees screen and create a new employee.

02:33.270 --> 02:34.660
So get this scroll all the way down.

02:35.380 --> 02:41.150
To the nav bar section and you can see it there is a distinct section here called navigation bar right

02:41.150 --> 02:41.960
button.

02:42.260 --> 02:46.760
And so this is where all the documentation is for tell me what different options you have for putting

02:46.790 --> 02:53.670
a nav bar button on the right or the nav bar button on the right hand side of the navigation bar area.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.800
So clearly there's a bunch of great props on here you like I see stuff like right.

02:57.800 --> 03:04.010
Title so optional string to appear appear to the right and then it looks like there is an event handler

03:04.010 --> 03:08.840
here called on right which will be called Whenever the right nav bar button is pressed.

03:08.990 --> 03:15.950
So seems to me like we could provide a right title of like you know a string of ADD and then an on right

03:15.970 --> 03:16.890
callback.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.520
And whenever someone taps on this thing unright will get called and we can use our actions helper from

03:22.580 --> 03:26.720
the same library to navigate over to like a new ad screen.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.290
Right like that that makes a lot of sense.

03:30.290 --> 03:36.210
Well here's the part that gets a little bit weird a little bit funky when it comes to the documentation.

03:36.410 --> 03:42.170
So it looks like these are the properties we care about but where exactly do we add these props like

03:42.170 --> 03:43.020
where do they go.

03:43.020 --> 03:43.230
Right.

03:43.250 --> 03:49.010
OK I the navigation bar but we haven't really made direct access to any type of navigation bar just

03:49.010 --> 03:49.180
yet.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.400
Here's more stuff on the left button.

03:51.410 --> 03:55.410
More stuff on the back button some more stuff on the title.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.910
And then his navigation bars.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.770
So it tells you.

03:57.770 --> 04:02.720
I agree it does a great job telling you about all the different props are available to you but it doesn't

04:02.720 --> 04:06.210
quite tell you where the heck these things are going which I don't know.

04:06.210 --> 04:11.540
First I find a little bit interesting anyways though the big trick here the big secret is that all those

04:11.540 --> 04:16.490
props can be provided directly to the scene component and a scene component will make sure they get

04:16.620 --> 04:18.050
forwarded onto the right spot.

04:18.050 --> 04:23.930
So basically we can customize our Hetter from the scene components whenever this scene right here at

04:23.930 --> 04:25.490
the employee list is shown.

04:25.490 --> 04:30.330
It'll take any props we pressed to it and I'll forward them off to the headers well.

04:30.670 --> 04:36.640
So we're going to pass this thing a right title to make the button show up.

04:36.650 --> 04:40.330
You know something that says hey Atta employer or whoever wanted to say.

04:40.330 --> 04:46.070
And they'll also give it an on right function that will be called whenever a user taps on that button.

04:46.070 --> 04:49.430
So let's give this a shot because it's going to take a lot of props.

04:49.430 --> 04:55.180
Now I'm going to put in some new lines just to get myself a little bit of space and then I'm going to

04:55.180 --> 05:09.460
add in a right title of add in all out in an on right of return now is a console log of rape.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.470
Let's go ahead.

05:10.470 --> 05:11.640
Give us a shot.

05:11.850 --> 05:18.960
I'll refresh my simulator get my counsel being open because I want to see that console log and I will

05:18.960 --> 05:25.540
do a test at test dot com password of password log in and hot dog.

05:25.650 --> 05:28.030
We got the button on the right hand side and we tap it.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.960
Yup it works.

05:29.970 --> 05:35.500
So again the documentation here is fantastic for describing what these properties are for.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.300
But it's a little bit lacking in terms of telling you where these things actually go.

05:39.300 --> 05:45.600
In the case of the navigation bar we can just throw it all on the scene and just pop up in the right

05:45.600 --> 05:46.220
spot.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.000
Whenever we go to the appropriate scene.

05:49.050 --> 05:52.580
All right let's go into the next section and get started on our employee form
