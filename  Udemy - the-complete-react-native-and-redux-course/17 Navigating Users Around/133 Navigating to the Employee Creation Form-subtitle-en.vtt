WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:06.510
We now have a big button on the right hand side of our out that it will allow us to basically do anything

00:06.510 --> 00:07.970
we want when we press on it.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.220
So we need to now making new component that is going to serve for creating a new employee.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.240
We don't have a form to show the user just yet.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.790
So in the section we're going to put together some scaffolding for a new employee form or a form to

00:20.790 --> 00:25.080
create a new employee and then we're going to make sure we can navigate there whenever we press this

00:25.170 --> 00:26.670
add button.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.850
So we'll start off with the form first in my component's directory.

00:30.870 --> 00:38.460
I'll make a new file called employee create dot J.S. and then inside of a year we'll toss in a little

00:38.460 --> 00:39.460
bit of boilerplate.

00:39.510 --> 00:53.250
So import react and component components and from re-act will grab a view and text from re-act native.

00:53.250 --> 00:57.500
I definitely expect that we're going to be using our reusable components instead of you in text but

00:57.500 --> 01:01.700
for right now we just want to kind of get something on the screen.

01:01.710 --> 01:06.720
We'll make an employee create form that will extend component

01:09.460 --> 01:10.600
and from the render method

01:13.540 --> 01:15.230
we return a view.

01:17.630 --> 01:24.850
With some text it says like employee form.

01:24.990 --> 01:32.220
And finally at the bottom will tell us on our export statement.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.050
All right.

01:33.190 --> 01:38.910
So just to get some content on the page something just get us started.

01:39.010 --> 01:45.790
So we need to actually make sure that the router knows about this component here and Krita seem to represent

01:45.790 --> 01:46.760
this component.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.450
So we're going to flip on back to our router.

01:49.450 --> 01:51.700
I will import our new form.

01:51.700 --> 02:02.730
So import employee create from components employee create and I will make a new scene.

02:02.860 --> 02:08.050
Now this is where I need to ask myself the question should this scene go underneath the kind of off

02:08.080 --> 02:10.330
bucket or is underneath the main bucket.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.870
And to answer that question I need to think about how I want users to navigate to this.

02:14.890 --> 02:22.240
I want to use or sell the ability to navigate from the employee list to the employee create form.

02:22.420 --> 02:26.440
And once they're on the create form if they decide Oh you know what I don't actually want to create

02:26.440 --> 02:32.050
a new employee that they like don't press that back button I should kick them back to the employee list

02:32.050 --> 02:32.560
component.

02:32.560 --> 02:38.040
So it sounds like is going to be in this channel of all the different main scenes that I have.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.590
It's definitely an added inside of your own make a new scene

02:46.270 --> 02:51.520
that has a title of create employ.

02:51.550 --> 02:53.470
So that's what the users are going to see.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.280
Well give me a key in your let's get order of properties right here.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.120
I want to see at least somewhat consistent.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.890
We'll put the key first.

03:03.410 --> 03:12.780
So we'll give it a key of employed create a component of employee creates That's what we need.

03:12.790 --> 03:17.160
Yep and boy create and then we've got the title of create employee.

03:17.330 --> 03:17.660
OK.

03:17.690 --> 03:20.370
So this definitely looks good right here.

03:20.420 --> 03:21.690
Let's see it.

03:21.710 --> 03:23.580
I want to do a quick refresh.

03:23.750 --> 03:24.510
See where we're at

03:31.020 --> 03:33.820
all log in.

03:34.090 --> 03:37.840
And you know I just realize we're testing it here but we haven't actually hooked up this button just

03:37.840 --> 03:38.290
yet.

03:38.290 --> 03:39.490
My mistake.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.830
Let's do that first.

03:40.840 --> 03:46.960
So on my scene for the employee list right now we've got a console log whenever someone presses the

03:46.960 --> 03:48.250
on right button.

03:48.250 --> 03:53.680
I want to navigate to the employee create screens employ create screen instead.

03:53.770 --> 04:00.190
So don't remove the console log and remember how we do navigation with this routing library we call

04:00.220 --> 04:04.630
actions dot and then the key of the scene that we want to go to.

04:04.630 --> 04:08.680
So it'll be employee create.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.710
I have not imported actions into this file just yet.

04:11.720 --> 04:18.700
So I will also import actions from the re-act native router fluxed library area.

04:18.850 --> 04:19.220
OK.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.040
Now we should be in place where it actually works.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.840
So I will refresh the simulator again

04:28.470 --> 04:31.460
throw in our credentials.

04:31.890 --> 04:37.590
Now I should really click add and I go over to my employee form and I can click back if I decide you

04:37.590 --> 04:40.460
know what I don't want to make anything and then toggle between the two.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.710
You'll notice that in the simulator I don't know if the video quite translates it.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.450
Maybe you see it in your simulator.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.710
It's a little bit like.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.450
You know there's a little bit of jittery here once you're actually on a mobile device all that stuff

04:51.450 --> 04:53.490
goes away and everything will work just fine.

04:53.490 --> 05:00.200
So it's really just an oddity of the simulator that you see that little can a bit Jane Guinness.

05:00.390 --> 05:07.170
Now just as a reminder we have two scenes inside of our main scene or the main bucket as I kind of like

05:07.170 --> 05:09.870
to refer to it as the two scenes in here.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.000
I start to want to think about how I'm going to use that initial prop.

05:14.190 --> 05:19.110
Remember initially it was what is in charge of deciding what scenes didn't show up first.

05:19.170 --> 05:24.870
So by default order of operations would excuse me order of declaration will come into play since the

05:24.870 --> 05:26.010
employee list is declared.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.990
First it will be shown first.

05:28.020 --> 05:33.210
Whenever someone says hey go over to Maine please but just to make sure it's nice and clear.

05:33.210 --> 05:37.100
I would probably choose to add on the initial prop here as well.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.370
So now for sure.

05:38.370 --> 05:42.930
Like without a doubt just in case anyone else comes across and adds a new scene here I don't have to

05:42.930 --> 05:48.480
worry about a user going to that scene instead of the one I really intend to go to so I'm going to throw

05:48.480 --> 05:53.260
the initial on there just to be a model citizen.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.580
All right so we can now navigate over to our form.

05:55.620 --> 06:00.810
I think that we can probably start working on that employee creation forum in the next section
