00:00.740 --> 00:03.380
We're starting to really pick up some speed on our application.

00:03.380 --> 00:05.760
I like it let's keep rolling through.

00:05.780 --> 00:10.580
We now have the ability to navigate over the two this simply form which means we can finally start focusing

00:10.970 --> 00:16.920
on having some real functionality to our app by giving users the ability to create employees.

00:16.930 --> 00:17.500
All right.

00:17.510 --> 00:21.890
So before we start work on the farm itself I want make sure that we're on the same page as to what this

00:21.890 --> 00:22.990
forum needs to do.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.340
Exactly.

00:24.380 --> 00:30.320
So when employees created where they're going to have three properties assigned to them a name a phone

00:30.320 --> 00:32.890
number and a shift time or shift days.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.760
Really what is the shift they will be the day of the week that they are scheduled to work.

00:38.170 --> 00:45.620
So for the phone number and the name the first two entries here we can definitely reuse the input component

00:45.620 --> 00:49.110
that we've already created previously the reusable component.

00:49.280 --> 00:54.050
On the other hand for the shift where they have to pick a day of the week we're probably going to want

00:54.050 --> 00:58.250
to make sure that we display the choices for them and they should only be able to use or should only

00:58.250 --> 01:01.650
be able to pick from one of these existing options on here.

01:01.670 --> 01:07.820
So Monday Tuesday Wednesday you get the idea after the user enters all this stuff we should validate

01:07.820 --> 01:09.590
their inputs in some fashion.

01:09.590 --> 01:15.440
So you make sure they actually entered a value for each one of these and then it's Add a button on to

01:15.440 --> 01:16.670
submit it all.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.940
Now we did something really similar with a log in form.

01:19.940 --> 01:25.520
So we're going to make sure you know of course that we're absolutely concrete and understanding on how

01:25.520 --> 01:26.660
to put a form together.

01:26.660 --> 01:32.280
So this is going to be another exercise in form generation and form validation.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.380
We'll make sure that the component or we'll make the components.

01:35.510 --> 01:40.370
We're going to wire them up to some action creators make a reduce or to hold all the values in the forms

01:40.460 --> 01:44.240
and then make an action crater to actually save the form.

01:44.240 --> 01:50.420
Now there is one twist in here that I really want to add in that I really want to add one more twist

01:50.770 --> 01:53.600
on all the boxes shown you so far tonight.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.110
I know this is a horrible example right here.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.370
Maybe I've got a better one blah blah.

01:58.400 --> 02:04.070
I guess I'll have to do all the mocks passionately before it kind of showed this form as having like

02:04.160 --> 02:10.710
editing capability is right like a save button a fire button text button to text that employee.

02:10.820 --> 02:16.250
But now I'm claiming that we're going to have a form that is solely made for creating an employee and

02:16.250 --> 02:20.190
not really kind of viewing one or editing one.

02:20.200 --> 02:27.190
So if we're going to make a edit form or kind of like a show form to show an existing record and a creative

02:27.190 --> 02:32.370
form maybe it would be a waste of time to make two separate forms.

02:32.410 --> 02:33.660
Right.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.250
Maybe we should make just one form and reuse it for both the Create and the edit as well.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.660
So for now we're going to focus on just the Create aspect to the form.

02:42.670 --> 02:48.070
But I want you to keep that thought in mind or I want you to remember that that maybe recreating this

02:48.070 --> 02:52.470
form for both create and edit doesn't make a lot of sense.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.660
But anyways we're going to concentrate on just create right now.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.040
So let's get started for the form itself.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.510
You probably got a good idea of what we need to do.

03:01.510 --> 03:08.710
We're going to import some of our reusable components put on some labels some card sections some inputs

03:09.040 --> 03:10.230
just get a form on the page.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.500
It's going look very similar to the log in form to start.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.310
So we're going to breeze right through it first.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.510
We do not need the re-act need of import any more.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.760
We're gonna replace it with all of our own custom components.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.400
It's going to take those out.

03:22.810 --> 03:34.000
I'll pull in my card card section input and button from common and then inside of the employee create

03:34.000 --> 03:43.720
component replace it with a card and a couple of card sections.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.950
So I'm going to copy paste the card section down.

03:47.010 --> 03:53.700
I'm going to skip the worrying about the picker right now hours selecting the date because I definitely

03:53.700 --> 03:55.320
want a new custom component in there.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.300
So right now I'm not going to worry about it.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.650
We're going to come back to it in a future section.

04:00.720 --> 04:08.070
So in the first card section I'll place my first input which is going to be responsible for getting

04:08.070 --> 04:12.160
the employee's name and I'll give it a placeholder.

04:12.180 --> 04:21.230
Jane then for the second and put this one is going to be responsible for collecting the phone number

04:22.730 --> 04:27.490
given the label of just a phone and a placeholder.

04:27.730 --> 04:28.550
555

04:31.410 --> 04:33.360
looks good.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.570
Again the third card section is give me that picture.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.050
I'm going to ignore it right now.

04:37.090 --> 04:42.310
So the last thing I need to do is place a button inside of the last card section.

04:42.420 --> 04:49.600
So place my button and I want to say something like save all we can do to create now.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.310
Yes create.

04:51.570 --> 04:52.470
Let's go to create.

04:52.470 --> 04:53.360
Why not.

04:53.910 --> 04:54.520
OK.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.860
I'm sure this all works good.

04:55.860 --> 05:00.420
So I'm oh I will refresh the simulator just to make sure I don't have a compilation error or anything

05:00.420 --> 05:05.800
like that any typos but I'm going to skip the process of actually logging in and checking it out.

05:06.160 --> 05:06.450
OK.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.380
So a good place to start with our form.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.140
Let's continue in the next section by starting to wire up our action creators our reducers all that

05:13.140 --> 05:14.290
kind of good stuff.
