00:00.970 --> 00:05.280
In the last section we installed the re-act router native fluxed library.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.190
I had a little bit of a discussion about scenes and really just decided let's write some code.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.410
We're going to figure out how this thing works much more quickly by just diving right in.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.880
So I'm going to be a little bit of an abrupt here and I can do a huge introduction.

00:17.890 --> 00:21.550
I'm just going to kind of start working on some stuff and we'll figure out what's going on really quickly

00:22.270 --> 00:27.680
in my source directory and so my project I'm going to make a new file inside the source directory so

00:27.680 --> 00:31.550
it's not inside components it's inside of source and I call this router Dot.

00:31.630 --> 00:32.310
Yes.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.250
OK.

00:34.060 --> 00:39.640
The purpose of this file is to have one location where I can tweak all the different scenes that a user

00:39.640 --> 00:43.990
can navigate to or all the different routes that a user can navigate to.

00:43.990 --> 00:50.590
So in this fire file We're going to define all the different possible screens or scenes whichever way

00:50.590 --> 00:54.790
you want to refer to it as that a user can visit insider app.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.470
We'll be creating a component to do that.

00:57.670 --> 01:02.860
So we're start off by throwing in some boilerplate to make the functional component.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.730
So at the top we'll import react from react.

01:06.130 --> 01:09.410
I'll make a component called router component.

01:09.710 --> 01:12.010
Now I know the name here is a little bit funky.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.820
Do make sure do call this you know please call his router component.

01:15.820 --> 01:23.620
Do not just call it router what the full word in there at the bottom we will export default router component

01:25.870 --> 01:28.170
and then we'll do a little bit more of imports.

01:28.230 --> 01:32.080
This is where we're going to start figuring out how this navigation stuff works.

01:32.080 --> 01:42.790
So we will import scene and router from re-act native Retter flux in both seen and router.

01:42.830 --> 01:47.420
This is why we did not call our component router even though it really is is because we are importing

01:47.420 --> 01:58.870
this other router object or variable into this file and we can import log in form use from our components

01:58.870 --> 02:03.890
directory components log and form.

02:04.870 --> 02:05.780
OK.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.220
So here we go.

02:08.230 --> 02:09.350
Let's get started again.

02:09.370 --> 02:11.210
I'm going to just throw some code on the screen.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.630
Not quite talked about it just yet.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.110
You know let's get stuff up and then we can figure out what's going on.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.520
I need a place down a router tag.

02:17.830 --> 02:22.600
And then inside of it we will define our first scene like so.

02:22.930 --> 02:25.820
Next we're going to pass this scene a couple of props.

02:25.840 --> 02:33.520
Some of the props we just discussed I'm going to give you a key of log in a component of log in form

02:34.510 --> 02:40.770
and a title of Please log in.

02:40.820 --> 02:46.190
Now the last thing I want to do is use this router inside of our application so we made this component

02:46.220 --> 02:48.470
just make it does absolutely nothing.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.620
We have to actually put it somewhere inside her application.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.680
So I'm going to flip back over to our out component.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.030
So here's my component.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.130
I'm going to import the router.

02:58.370 --> 03:05.660
So import router from router and we're going to place this router component inside of our render method

03:05.730 --> 03:07.820
and can replace the log and form to do so.

03:07.820 --> 03:14.060
So instead of showing the logon form going to show the excuse me the router.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.900
There we go and at the top.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.600
We're not using that log in any anymore it's going to clean up the import statement like so.

03:22.030 --> 03:22.420
OK.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.620
So again no discussion yet.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.150
Just throwing some code on the screen.

03:26.170 --> 03:29.650
I'm going to refresh and see what we get.

03:29.650 --> 03:35.050
Of course the first refresh is always a little bit slow because we've just imported this new library.

03:35.350 --> 03:36.050
Ok cool.

03:36.070 --> 03:37.290
There we go.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.080
So it looks all right.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.480
The styling is a little bit off but it looks like something definitely happened right here.

03:43.480 --> 03:43.920
You can see that.

03:43.930 --> 03:49.510
Now we've got a header inside our application automatically It says Please log in very prominently on

03:49.600 --> 03:50.540
the top.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.150
It is also cutting off our log in form.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.150
It's kind of hogging the screen here a little bit.

03:55.390 --> 03:59.920
So let's go to the next section we'll do a review on all the code that we just wrote and we'll also

03:59.920 --> 04:05.100
figure out how we're going to kind of figure out this very obvious display bug that we have right here
