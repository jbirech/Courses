00:01.020 --> 00:02.430
We've got our picture in place.

00:02.430 --> 00:07.500
But I'm really going to nit pick here just a little bit and mention that this picture does not have

00:07.500 --> 00:08.950
a label right.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.430
We don't actually see anything here like hey pick the employees shift users really need to know what

00:14.430 --> 00:15.380
they're selecting here.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.290
So we should really make sure that we have a label here as well.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.920
So to add in the label we will make a separate component this time around.

00:23.970 --> 00:29.490
Just because you know we have to kind of specify the days that we here it's a lot of customization for

00:29.490 --> 00:30.900
a reusable component.

00:30.930 --> 00:37.500
I think that this is maybe a reasonable case to just have the raw picker in here to add in a label.

00:37.500 --> 00:44.550
We will need to import a text element from re-act me as well will place a text element in the card section

00:44.580 --> 00:49.240
right above the picker and will style it appropriately to make it look like a label.

00:49.290 --> 00:55.810
So if at the top I'm going to import my text tag from re-act native and then back down.

00:55.860 --> 01:00.370
Right above the picker word in our text.

01:00.610 --> 01:01.520
Whoops.

01:04.250 --> 01:08.120
And I think it would be appropriate to just how these things shift.

01:08.120 --> 01:13.360
You can have it you know something more Burby might be like select a shift that might be good as well.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.300
And I'm going to give it a style of styles.

01:16.340 --> 01:24.670
Dot picker text style maybe also pick her label syle might be appropriate as well.

01:24.770 --> 01:29.330
All right we have not yet to find our styles object so scroll down to the bottom and make sure we define

01:29.330 --> 01:29.970
that.

01:30.370 --> 01:42.180
So right above map stage props say styles is an object with a picture text style.

01:42.260 --> 01:46.960
This will have a font size of 18 in a padding left of 20.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.050
So just some.

01:48.050 --> 01:52.130
So I need to dial up the size and the padding left is going to make sure that it stands off from the

01:52.130 --> 01:57.020
left hand side of the form and lines up nicely with the name and phone here as well.

01:58.130 --> 01:58.600
All right.

01:58.850 --> 02:02.590
Let's do a quick refresh and see how this looks.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.110
So in my ad form.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.630
Hmm interesting.

02:12.640 --> 02:16.130
So it looks like we definitely have the label on here.

02:16.150 --> 02:17.210
It's in a good spot.

02:17.230 --> 02:24.820
It has correct text correct size everything looks good but if you look down now our picture is a little

02:24.820 --> 02:29.100
bit off center whereas before is nicely centered inside this card section.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.650
You can see that now it's going to offset by the label that we put in here.

02:33.940 --> 02:39.870
The issue here is that the card section component has a style of flex direction row.

02:40.300 --> 02:46.510
If you recall that means that all of the card sections children will be laid out going from left to

02:46.510 --> 02:47.350
right.

02:47.350 --> 02:51.280
So first there's the shift that takes up the full height of this thing.

02:51.340 --> 02:56.470
And then the next element in here will be placed to the right of that label and that's exactly what

02:56.470 --> 03:00.160
happened with this picture right here.

03:00.160 --> 03:06.940
So for this particular card section we really want to have a layout going from top to bottom or a flex

03:06.940 --> 03:09.260
direction of column.

03:09.280 --> 03:16.150
In other words we want to override this very specific card section style with some custom style that

03:16.150 --> 03:19.240
we can pass into the card section right here as a prop.

03:19.390 --> 03:25.060
So we need to make sure we can override the styling inside of this very particular card section right

03:25.060 --> 03:26.690
here.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.440
So that's the goal.

03:28.660 --> 03:33.160
There's really no great leading and I can give you for the methodology here this is def. those places

03:33.160 --> 03:36.720
we're going to throw the code on the screen and then talk about how it works.

03:37.030 --> 03:39.900
So inside my employee create form.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.060
Here's my card section.

03:41.080 --> 03:50.290
I'm going to give it a prop of style and then to that I will pass an object with flex direction column.

03:50.290 --> 03:56.280
Now I want to point out to you that on all of the primitive elements that we've used so far like text

03:56.280 --> 04:03.640
or picture or touchable opacity whatever might have been all those except a style prop and re-act native

04:03.700 --> 04:06.030
internally makes use of that style problem.

04:06.510 --> 04:09.020
This card section here however it is a start.

04:09.040 --> 04:16.080
It is a component that we put together and there is nearly no property that will be automatically consumed

04:16.090 --> 04:20.690
for us are automatically used when it's a component that we put together.

04:20.710 --> 04:25.660
So just because I added on style in here doesn't actually mean that it's going to do anything meaningful

04:25.900 --> 04:28.350
inside of the card section component.

04:28.390 --> 04:34.210
I have to open the card section component and make sure that I make use of this prop that I'm passing

04:34.210 --> 04:39.850
to the card section and I have to do this because it is a component that we created.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.020
So I'm going to open up the card section.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.110
Here's my card S. component.

04:44.110 --> 04:47.080
We haven't looked at this thing in a while right.

04:47.080 --> 04:54.190
So now my props object I'm going to expect it to maybe have a prop of style on there as well.

04:54.250 --> 04:58.310
So I need to somehow make use of that prop inside this component.

04:58.330 --> 05:04.120
Essentially what we want to do is take these styles dot container style and then overwrite it with any

05:04.120 --> 05:07.440
additional styles that were passed in on the props object.

05:07.490 --> 05:13.170
This is another location where you go through the code up to talk about what it's doing.

05:13.360 --> 05:21.400
I'm going to wrap the styles container style with an array as the second argument I'll pass in prop

05:21.400 --> 05:25.240
Staats style suits me props the real style.

05:25.330 --> 05:29.600
So this is a nice little trick with styling and react native right here.

05:29.680 --> 05:37.530
This style prop that gets passed to any primitive element like a viewer or a text can take an array.

05:37.540 --> 05:45.640
If we pass in an array of styles then the style most to the right will overwrite any style on the left.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.660
So a nice little trick here right.

05:48.930 --> 05:52.370
What this does is it's going to say hey use the container style.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.490
But if there is anything better being passed along on props out style use that instead.

05:57.580 --> 06:05.110
So basically exactly fits our use case because by default we want to have a flex direction of row unless

06:05.110 --> 06:10.290
we specifically pass an override of flex direction column.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.280
All right.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.960
So I flip back over to employee create.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.040
I'm going to refresh my simulator and see how we look now.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.670
So log back in

06:25.030 --> 06:27.400
go to my form and hot dog.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.240
This looks a lot better now when the form starts off and it's on Monday.

06:31.240 --> 06:36.670
It does look like there's a lot of white space right here but really that's you know that's just how

06:36.880 --> 06:39.240
a picture with iOS works.

06:39.310 --> 06:43.630
Once the user starts to scroll up they're going to see OK that's why there is that white space right

06:43.630 --> 06:44.150
there.

06:44.380 --> 06:49.180
So certainly when I start to go to like Saturday it is very clear why there's the white space above

06:49.180 --> 06:50.540
the Monday on the form.

06:50.930 --> 06:51.290
OK.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.240
This looks good.

06:52.240 --> 06:58.040
I think we are finally just about ready to start saving the data that this form is producing.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.250
Let's take care of that in the next section.
