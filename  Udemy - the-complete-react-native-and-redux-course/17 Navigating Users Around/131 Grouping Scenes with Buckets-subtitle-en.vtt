00:00.770 --> 00:06.280
Unless section we saw that we got some automatic navigation between our scenes working but there is

00:06.280 --> 00:08.760
that little bit of oddity of that right hander.

00:08.830 --> 00:13.130
You know what I just realized I've been saying right handed and it's actually the left hand.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.800
Oh my gosh you guys.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.120
Oh man how embarrassing.

00:17.560 --> 00:22.680
Well I was thinking about right hand from the device's perspective.

00:22.700 --> 00:26.600
That's that is my that is my that is my.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.010
That is what I'm going to claim.

00:28.020 --> 00:28.600
OK.

00:28.830 --> 00:29.590
How embarrassing.

00:29.700 --> 00:38.400
Well such as the way we're going to roll right on Anyways we the nav bar up you're automatically from

00:38.400 --> 00:39.670
the routeing library.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.960
So definitely getting a lot of free functionality here.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.460
But we definitely don't want that button on the left hand side.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.520
Let's figure out how this thing's working.

00:47.950 --> 00:51.390
Figure out the fix here is going to require a little bit more knowledge on how scenes work.

00:51.390 --> 00:54.480
So let's just take a quick break and figure out how the thing works out.

00:55.830 --> 00:59.070
OK first off want to start back here at this diagram that we were looking at before.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.710
So we looked at this diagram a couple of seconds ago and I had said that we have two separate flows.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.400
We've got an authentication flow and the main flow.

01:07.520 --> 01:13.750
So think of these two flows right now and tell me where you think it's appropriate to have a back button.

01:13.820 --> 01:19.160
Right now we have a back button going from this employee list screen to the authentication screen.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.810
And it probably doesn't make sense to have it there right now.

01:21.830 --> 01:26.960
You know if if that thing actually said like sign out or log out then yes it would make sense.

01:26.960 --> 01:31.400
But right now just having like a button with no explanation doesn't make sense at all.

01:31.420 --> 01:34.220
Some say having a backpack in between these two.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.420
Definitely it does not.

01:37.010 --> 01:39.770
In some places it does make sense to have a backup.

01:39.780 --> 01:46.490
However for example when I'm on my employee list if I tap on an employee and go to this kind of detail

01:46.490 --> 01:52.520
or create screen you know whatever it is it does make sense to have a back button to go back to my employee

01:52.520 --> 01:53.660
list over here.

01:53.660 --> 01:57.100
So in some cases it makes sense to have a back button.

01:57.140 --> 02:01.360
In others it does not.

02:01.450 --> 02:04.630
We go one more go.

02:05.020 --> 02:10.150
So to understand this behavior and how it works how that back button works we can do what is called

02:10.210 --> 02:17.830
seen nesting or recontest different scenes on application right now our auth Flo has a single screen

02:18.010 --> 02:22.870
and there is no screen that you should be able to go to where there should be like a next button or

02:22.870 --> 02:23.790
a back button.

02:23.950 --> 02:30.970
So we're going to nest our logon screen in its own separate scene with a single key of auth and know

02:30.970 --> 02:33.850
of nothing else no other process whatsoever.

02:33.850 --> 02:34.870
We can now think of this.

02:34.870 --> 02:38.130
And I'm going to kind of colloquially referred to as like a scene bucket.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.370
We now have an author bucket.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.350
And if I go to any other scene of my application I'm going to be leaving the bucket.

02:45.470 --> 02:51.780
And any time that I leave the soft bucket I'm not going to get any back buttons or anything like that.

02:51.930 --> 02:57.540
On the other hand we want to have a forward and back button to go between the employee list and employee

02:57.540 --> 03:00.520
create or employee form know whatever we end up calling the sing over here.

03:00.750 --> 03:06.150
So it does make sense to nest the two of them together in their own scene bucket because they're in

03:06.150 --> 03:07.030
their own bucket.

03:07.140 --> 03:12.820
Anytime I go between them I am going to expect to have a back button and a forward button.

03:12.960 --> 03:18.270
Now to be really clear this is behavior that is automatically implemented for us by our routing library.

03:18.480 --> 03:24.690
So all we have to do is Nest our scenes and then the presence of the back button will be automatically

03:24.690 --> 03:26.090
inferred for us.

03:26.460 --> 03:27.290
So let's go to the shot.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.700
Let's just see how it works.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.890
Back inside of my rodder component I'm going to add another scene

03:37.660 --> 03:47.620
of Auth. and I'm going to wrap my log in component with it and add another one with the key of main.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.580
And I'm also going to wrap my employee list with that one.

03:51.610 --> 03:53.950
So now I have two separate scene buckets.

03:53.950 --> 03:59.090
And by the way this term I'm using here bucket it is solely for the purposes of this course.

03:59.190 --> 04:04.420
It is not an official term but it's one that I find very helpful for kind of understanding what is going

04:04.420 --> 04:05.420
on here.

04:05.490 --> 04:12.070
So now because these are two separate buckets we can freely navigate between either of them without

04:12.070 --> 04:13.890
getting any back button.

04:13.910 --> 04:18.750
Now there is one little gotcha here and this is a very painful Gotcha.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.280
And that is why I'm going to tell it to you right now.

04:21.280 --> 04:27.520
We had been using the actions dot employee list to navigate over to this scene.

04:27.580 --> 04:27.890
Right.

04:27.910 --> 04:31.160
We'd like you know we just added that inside of our action crater's file.

04:31.300 --> 04:36.040
Here's logging user success here is actions not employee list.

04:36.190 --> 04:41.980
So the gotcha is whenever we are navigating between different buckets we cannot navigate directly to

04:41.980 --> 04:43.580
a nested scene.

04:43.600 --> 04:51.310
So now when I want to go from the log in scene right here over to my employee list I am instead going

04:51.310 --> 04:57.200
to call actions dot main and then rely upon that to dump me on my employee list.

04:57.220 --> 05:00.340
So it is a nasty little gotcha.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.830
One just one that we've got to deal with.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.960
So back in our action critter's file rather than going to actions dot employee list I'm going to go

05:07.960 --> 05:13.840
to actions dot main and then right now because my employee list is the only scene in here.

05:14.020 --> 05:17.160
This scene will be shown automatically for us.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.960
OK so time for a little bit of text.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.520
Refresh the simulator.

05:23.630 --> 05:28.150
I will put in my e-mail.

05:28.240 --> 05:33.730
Let's log in and now you'll notice I don't have the button on the left hand side anymore.

05:34.180 --> 05:34.600
OK.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.910
So definitely working the way that we expect now.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.070
I think our navigation is a pretty good spot.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.990
So let's continue in the next section
