00:01.560 --> 00:06.350
We've got a scaffold put together for our form inducer and I remembered just like the log in form.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.860
This is the thing that is going to govern all the different values on our form for creating an employee.

00:11.880 --> 00:17.400
So when a user selects some input like this name right here and they start typing they are going to

00:17.400 --> 00:19.140
be producing a name.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.770
Same thing with phone and same thing for the shift.

00:21.780 --> 00:29.850
So our go into maintaining three properties of state the name the phone and the shift we've already

00:29.850 --> 00:35.670
wired up an action creator to handle the employee update type which is our idea of you know handling

00:35.670 --> 00:39.060
update from the user typing on the keyboard on the device.

00:39.060 --> 00:45.700
So let's put in some code to handle this employee update case will say employee update.

00:45.780 --> 00:46.930
Now here's the fun part.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.070
Here's the fun part.

00:48.120 --> 00:53.850
I had said that our actions payload number let's flip back over to the employee actions file real quick

00:54.360 --> 01:03.420
the actions payload will be an object having the key of Propp and a key value and each of those represents

01:03.430 --> 01:07.540
like the proper name and the actual value number property.

01:07.550 --> 01:13.920
There will be a name phone or shift and the value will be whatever the value of the input itself will

01:13.920 --> 01:14.330
be.

01:14.490 --> 01:19.110
So again just to make sure it's really clear I'm going to put in you know just a comment here really

01:19.110 --> 01:21.690
quickly.

01:21.690 --> 01:35.220
Action not pay payload is going to look something like a name or a prop prop name and value of Jane

01:35.400 --> 01:36.180
or something like that.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.630
That is what the auctions payload is going to look like.

01:38.850 --> 01:46.830
So we need to somehow take this name right here and reflect that on our applications and on our application

01:46.830 --> 01:54.240
state or on this reduce or sales I should say with a value of Jane because that's what our goal here

01:54.240 --> 01:54.740
is.

01:54.930 --> 01:59.640
So we're going to use a little bit of E-6 to just make this happen a very nice fashion let's put the

01:59.640 --> 02:02.570
code down and then talk about what is going on here.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.680
Remember that because we are in reducer we always want to make sure that we return a new object as well.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.210
So I'm gonna return from here.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.200
Dot dot dot States.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.090
And then here's the fun part.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.490
Action dot payload dot prop.

02:17.610 --> 02:24.420
Make sure you get those square braces on there and then action dot payload dot value and then take out

02:24.420 --> 02:27.110
that comment here as well.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.740
All right.

02:27.840 --> 02:31.240
So this is a fun little bit of VSX.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.040
I want to say several times in a row these square braces right here are not an array.

02:37.150 --> 02:37.980
It's non-array.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.040
It's not an array.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.130
It is not an array that we're creating right here.

02:41.130 --> 02:43.890
This is called the interpellation.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.470
So the key that we are adding to this object right here will be determined at runtime.

02:49.830 --> 02:56.760
If we call our action Creator with a prop of name this whole segment right here this little chunk of

02:56.760 --> 03:04.770
code will turn into name like so if we call our action Creator with a prop of shift this whole segment

03:04.800 --> 03:08.510
will turn into shifts and so on with phone numbers as well.

03:08.670 --> 03:14.670
So it is a nice little bit of syntax from iOS 6 just to avoid having to do something a little bit more

03:14.670 --> 03:16.080
painful.

03:16.110 --> 03:22.320
Basically if you want to use without ESX we would end up doing that you know tried and true thing that

03:22.320 --> 03:32.150
looks like this where we do declare the object and then have to say Action payload prob equals action.

03:32.250 --> 03:38.560
Payload value and then do the DOT DOT DOT state with a dot dot dot new state as well.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.370
But this is really ugly right here.

03:40.370 --> 03:45.750
Just nasty stuff using the key interpellation really saves us a little bit of pain.

03:46.470 --> 03:47.200
All right.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.730
But a semi-colon on there.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.830
And I think we're in a good spot now.

03:51.240 --> 03:56.070
So we've now got an action creator and reduce or put together so we can start to wire up inside our

03:56.070 --> 03:56.900
form.

03:56.910 --> 04:02.310
I think the last thing I want to do in the producer is again put in some initial state here some reasonable

04:02.310 --> 04:08.730
initial state just to make sure that it's clear what properties this reducer is going to be maintaining.

04:08.760 --> 04:14.430
So I expect it to have a name that's going to start off as empty string a phone which will be an empty

04:14.430 --> 04:18.680
string and a shift.

04:19.190 --> 04:23.640
I think we're looking pretty good here.

04:24.150 --> 04:30.240
Before we flip on back to our form and start to wired up I did mention that we were going to do a little

04:30.240 --> 04:33.000
bit of re factor in our action crater's file.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.030
Remember we created our new action Creator having to do with employees inside the employee actions full

04:38.040 --> 04:44.020
of file but we still have a whole bunch of actions related to authentication in the index on file.

04:44.250 --> 04:52.560
So I'd really like to just do a quick refactor here just to make sure this is nice and clean have separate

04:52.560 --> 04:55.430
files for each of our action creators.

04:55.740 --> 05:04.030
So it really quickly in my actions folder I'm going to make a new file called auth actions and then

05:04.030 --> 05:08.740
inside if you're going to take everything that I've got inside the index file right now I'm going to

05:08.740 --> 05:17.400
cut it I'll put it into the office actions and now I get to treat my index file right here just as well

05:17.660 --> 05:23.250
as the same as we did with our common index file as well inside of our reusable components folder.

05:23.260 --> 05:28.030
So remember in there the idea was that we would import a file and immediately export it.

05:28.030 --> 05:29.410
At the same time.

05:29.590 --> 05:42.610
So inside of my actions index j yes will say export star from all factions and export star from employee

05:42.640 --> 05:44.270
auctions as well.

05:45.970 --> 05:52.010
I know this was a little side topic but I wanted to make sure we got that done before we forgot about

05:52.010 --> 05:52.300
it.

05:52.340 --> 05:57.170
So I can do a little bit of file cleanup here so that some in the open.

05:57.170 --> 05:58.990
All right let's take a quick break.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.470
Since we went a little bit out of were there to handle the Arthur actions and when we come back we'll

06:03.470 --> 06:09.290
make sure that we hook up our employee form reducer to our combined reducers call and then hook the

06:09.290 --> 06:11.680
whole thing up to our actual form component.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.980
So I'll see in the next section
