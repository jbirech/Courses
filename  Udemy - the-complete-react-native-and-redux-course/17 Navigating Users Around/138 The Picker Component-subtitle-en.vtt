WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:06.510
Our name and phone and puts in a pretty good spot right now but we still done absolutely no work whatsoever

00:06.540 --> 00:09.720
on the picker widget that is supposed to exist right here.

00:09.720 --> 00:14.190
So the ticker widget remember its goal is to show a list of the days of the week to the user so they

00:14.190 --> 00:18.080
can pick one of those days for this employee to work on.

00:18.390 --> 00:23.010
We're going to make use of a re-act need if primitive for this picker.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.840
It is called the picker component.

00:24.910 --> 00:27.440
Like OK has a pretty reasonable name.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.300
Let's check out the documentation on it.

00:29.310 --> 00:34.080
So some over here at the Riak native documentation and on the left hand side I'm going to scroll down

00:34.080 --> 00:40.560
until I find a picture and I want specifically to use the picture and not picture Iowa iOS picker Aiwass

00:40.560 --> 00:46.230
is obviously specifically for Iowa as this picture one will work well on either iOS or Android.

00:46.230 --> 00:51.870
So definitely what we want to hear is a very simple example of the picture on the screen.

00:51.930 --> 00:53.890
The API is really not too bad.

00:53.910 --> 01:00.580
We will import the picker component from re-act native We will give it the currently selected value.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.240
So look at you know they're using the same pattern as us.

01:03.240 --> 01:08.440
They're making what is called a controlled component which is one in which we tell it what its value

01:08.440 --> 01:09.560
should be.

01:09.750 --> 01:17.010
And then for each option in here as well we will add in a picture dot item component with a label and

01:17.010 --> 01:19.070
a value that matches up to it.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.860
Notice that label and value are separated out as two separate things.

01:22.860 --> 01:29.940
This is in case maybe you've got a like pretty English version of a label and then maybe a internally

01:29.940 --> 01:34.150
meaningful but not really user friendly value that you want to set as well.

01:34.680 --> 01:41.700
So maybe if you have a label of Java's is a fantastic example right here the external label that the

01:41.700 --> 01:47.140
user sees is javascript but the internal value that your application is going to use is going to be

01:47.280 --> 01:48.400
yes.

01:48.570 --> 01:50.220
Great example right there.

01:50.220 --> 01:55.410
So let's implement this Pickert component inside our application.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.790
I'm at my employee create form.

01:57.830 --> 02:02.690
The first thing you have to do is employer is import the picker from react native.

02:02.690 --> 02:12.140
So at the top we will add an import picker from re-act native and then I can scroll down to my unused

02:12.140 --> 02:13.160
card section.

02:13.160 --> 02:16.670
Here it is right here and allowed in my picker

02:19.920 --> 02:22.280
We'll start first with the picker options.

02:22.530 --> 02:28.620
So I need seven of these things I need a label and I need a value as well.

02:28.620 --> 02:34.470
So I'm going to just kind of put one empty one right here first and then I'd since I know that I need

02:34.470 --> 02:38.000
seven one more.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.270
And now here comes the fun part Monday.

02:41.270 --> 02:42.420
Well here let's.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.680
Yeah well we'll just do this one by one.

02:45.860 --> 02:50.300
We're going to use a label and value of the same exact thing.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.210
We'll make it the property properly capitalized

02:55.670 --> 02:56.800
value of the day of the week.

02:56.810 --> 03:02.210
So for us label of capital in Monday value of capital and Monday as well.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.760
All right now here's where the fancy parts can come in.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.630
This is why I just started there for a second.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.920
I'm just going to use multi-select for the rest of these.

03:10.280 --> 03:16.070
If you are using Adam or subline just in case you're curious you can highlight some little small portion

03:16.070 --> 03:23.440
of text right here and then press Commandery if you are on a Mac to multi-select these two that will

03:23.450 --> 03:26.950
give you the multiple cursors and I can do like Tuesday

03:29.710 --> 03:32.400
and then repeat for Wednesday

03:35.790 --> 03:36.870
you get the idea.

03:42.660 --> 03:51.350
Saturday Sunday this would definitely not be a horrible place to do a little bit of iteration as well

03:51.410 --> 03:56.300
to build up this list of Pickert items if you want to make an array of days of the week and then map

03:56.300 --> 04:00.010
over it and produce one paper item for each day of the week.

04:00.200 --> 04:00.850
Go for it.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.600
That is a fantastic choice as well.

04:04.520 --> 04:04.830
OK.

04:04.850 --> 04:06.340
So that is our picker options.

04:06.350 --> 04:13.910
Now we need to make sure that we declare the selected value and an on value change as well.

04:13.910 --> 04:19.100
So although the picker API or using declaring the picker is a little bit different as far as setting

04:19.100 --> 04:22.090
the value it is completely identical as the inputs.

04:22.160 --> 04:27.540
So our selected value will be this start prop stock shift.

04:27.590 --> 04:29.440
We do not yet have a shift.

04:29.450 --> 04:34.140
It is only when our form starts up that we're going to get this shift value of state.

04:34.460 --> 04:40.330
So then on value change this is what's going to be called whenever the picker's value changes.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.970
We called with the value out of the option that was selected.

04:44.180 --> 04:47.980
And for us that you know for us it's really the day I'm going to call it day right year

04:50.930 --> 04:54.510
then we'll call this stop props dot employee update.

04:54.620 --> 04:59.920
So remember we're using one action creator to handle all the different values that we're going to have.

04:59.930 --> 05:04.810
We'll give it a prop of shift and a value of day.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.140
And you know what I don't know I picked day here.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.680
Let's go with value as well.

05:08.690 --> 05:13.160
Just so we can keep the same pattern as what we use on the inputs as well.

05:13.160 --> 05:19.610
So I to change the argument to value and then we can shorten down the rest of the statement to just

05:19.610 --> 05:20.970
value as well.

05:21.230 --> 05:26.710
So value is my prop this shift with a value of value.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.240
Okay.

05:28.340 --> 05:29.780
So this sounds good.

05:30.260 --> 05:33.250
Let's do a quick refresh and see what it looks like.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.440
So we'll say test M.Com

05:41.090 --> 05:42.060
like with password

05:44.550 --> 05:45.710
and ha.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.030
How interesting.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.680
Here's my employee create form.

05:48.780 --> 05:53.300
It looks like there's definitely some height here but I don't actually see the picture at all.

05:53.670 --> 05:57.840
So this is one of those fantastic little gotchas in the world of re-act need.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.430
And there sure are a lot of them.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.320
That's why I'm here to help you out.

06:02.370 --> 06:03.380
That's my job.

06:03.690 --> 06:10.440
So by default the picker renders with a zero with set to it to make sure that it expands to fill all

06:10.440 --> 06:12.160
the area available to it.

06:12.210 --> 06:17.970
We have to set a we have to tell essentially to expand to fill all that area.

06:17.970 --> 06:22.700
Now remember how we tell a component to expand to fill all the available area.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.210
We passed cities style

06:27.480 --> 06:36.690
Sorry style of flex one like so to pass and flex one that tells it hey please expand to fill all the

06:36.690 --> 06:38.660
area available to you.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.080
Now I can sign in again

06:45.030 --> 06:51.300
go to the ADD form and boom there's my picker and so looks just like the normal US picker that you would

06:51.300 --> 06:52.900
expect to see.

06:52.950 --> 06:54.490
One thing you might find interesting.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.690
I've still got my android emulator open over here as well.

06:57.900 --> 07:02.070
So I'm going to do a quick refresh on it and then I will sign in

07:09.970 --> 07:18.000
and I'll go to the ad form and you'll notice that on here the picture still displays but is using the

07:18.000 --> 07:21.740
Android implementation of the picker's So it definitely looks a little bit different.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.000
It doesn't have the same kind of scrolling thing here that you would expect to see on iOS.

07:26.020 --> 07:28.150
There's just a difference between the two phones.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.180
Totally fine to see this on Android.

07:30.300 --> 07:35.120
And you know it still works the exact same way I can pick just one option here whereas on iOS I use

07:35.120 --> 07:38.090
a little slider to pick the one that I want.

07:38.130 --> 07:38.470
OK.

07:38.490 --> 07:39.560
So this looks good.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.330
Let's continue in the next section
