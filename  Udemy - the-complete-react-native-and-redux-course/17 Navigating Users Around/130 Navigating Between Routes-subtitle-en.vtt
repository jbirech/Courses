00:00.770 --> 00:05.960
We've now got to scene components in our application and we see that we can at least toggle between

00:05.960 --> 00:10.700
which one displays first by changing the order but obviously when the user actually makes use of our

00:10.700 --> 00:15.010
application we're not going to be sitting there next to them manually toggling the scenes.

00:15.050 --> 00:21.500
So we need some fashion to automatically navigate our users between different scenes that we've created.

00:21.500 --> 00:26.020
So let's think about how that's going to work inside of our application in particular.

00:26.030 --> 00:32.300
Well whenever a user enters email and password and logged in successfully chances are we're going to

00:32.300 --> 00:35.440
want to navigate a user over to that employee list.

00:35.480 --> 00:35.780
Right.

00:35.780 --> 00:41.090
Like you log in successfully you expect to see some new content on the screen.

00:41.120 --> 00:47.930
So I say that in our action creators file whenever we hit that user successfully logged in action creator

00:48.200 --> 00:52.370
that's probably when we're going to want to navigate our user over to this different screen.

00:52.580 --> 00:57.800
So that's probably where we're going to want to initiate this navigation process.

00:59.340 --> 01:05.070
So you know open up my action crater's file and I'm going to scroll down to the bottom and locate logon

01:05.070 --> 01:06.210
user success.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.110
OK so right here this is where I want to do my navigation.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.710
So this next part.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.210
Definitely another one of those places where we're going to throw some code on the screen and talk about

01:15.210 --> 01:17.160
what's going on at the top.

01:17.220 --> 01:27.120
I'm going to import actions from re-act native router flux and then back down at the bottom side of

01:27.120 --> 01:29.070
log in user success.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.780
I'm going to find my helper method.

01:30.780 --> 01:31.780
Here it is.

01:31.890 --> 01:39.610
And then right after it I'm going to call actions dot employee the list now without another word.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.230
Let's do a little bit of a test and see what happens.

01:45.110 --> 01:48.230
I mean I'm putting some correct authentication credentials.

01:48.350 --> 01:57.200
So that's going to be my test at test dot com and password and log in and boom I automatically get navigated

01:57.230 --> 01:58.910
over to my employee list.

01:58.910 --> 02:04.540
So clearly something here is happening correctly like it is working the way I expect.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.470
There is just one kind of interesting thing you'll notice that now I've got to back button up here.

02:09.500 --> 02:15.830
And so for some reason I'm able to like navigate back to the sign and sign in form which is now reset

02:15.920 --> 02:18.730
into making the user think that oh hey you haven't signed on yet.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.030
Please log in.

02:20.030 --> 02:20.560
So.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.980
OK it looks like we can navigate between different screens but still something is a little bit off.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.580
And we can navigate back and we definitely really do not want to.

02:29.180 --> 02:32.590
Let's take a second to talk about the code that we actually added in here.

02:32.640 --> 02:39.050
And the first thing I want to point out is we imported this actions object from the re-act need of router

02:39.050 --> 02:40.250
fluxed library.

02:40.260 --> 02:45.650
The second thing I want to point out is that we have this method on here called employee list that seems

02:45.650 --> 02:47.420
awfully coincidental doesn't it.

02:47.420 --> 02:52.780
Like this library has a method called employee list as you might expect.

02:52.910 --> 02:56.630
That is the purpose of this key property right here.

02:56.630 --> 02:59.260
So this is why that key property is so important.

02:59.390 --> 03:04.000
It is what we use as the engineers to navigate around in our application.

03:04.100 --> 03:11.270
If I create a scene with a key component I can navigate to it at any point in time from anywhere in

03:11.270 --> 03:20.090
my code base by just calling actions dot employee list or actions dot loggin you know whatever we might

03:20.090 --> 03:20.850
want to call it.

03:20.960 --> 03:27.350
That's all we have to call and boom will automatically be thrown over there with a nice animation.

03:27.350 --> 03:32.780
The next thing I want to point out to you is that we start to see why using the built in header is so

03:32.780 --> 03:33.260
useful.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.310
So if I log in again

03:37.300 --> 03:42.430
we get navigate over and yes the backbone here does not make sense but I want to at least point out

03:42.490 --> 03:48.280
that we got that back button for free so we didn't have to do anything like you know go into the employee

03:48.280 --> 03:51.460
list component and say oh please show a button up there.

03:51.470 --> 03:56.920
And you know figure out what the last view was and show the by and if anyone clicks on it go back to

03:56.920 --> 03:57.780
that last few.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.650
Let's that's a little bit tedious and we don't really want to do that for every single component.

04:01.660 --> 04:06.700
So by using this built in header we definitely get some good amount of functionality for free even if

04:06.700 --> 04:09.880
it's not something that we necessarily want inside of this case.

04:11.580 --> 04:16.800
All right so let's take a quick break here and figure out what's going on with his back button and how

04:16.800 --> 04:21.410
we're going to disable it when we go between the off screen and the employee lists screen
