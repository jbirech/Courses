00:00.780 --> 00:05.820
We've got our async action creator working just fine now but it's still missing a lot of that extra

00:05.820 --> 00:07.910
stuff that we need for one.

00:08.010 --> 00:12.940
The action itself is still a string rather than a true conc like we should be using now.

00:13.200 --> 00:19.080
And we also are not starting any spinner creating accounts if one doesn't exist or showing any error

00:19.080 --> 00:20.200
messages.

00:20.220 --> 00:27.090
So in this section we're going to add some more robust handling around this log in user action Creator.

00:27.090 --> 00:32.520
One thing to keep in mind as we work with redux thung is that because we have direct access to the dispatch

00:32.520 --> 00:38.700
method now we can dispatch as many methods or Simi Dispatch as many actions as we would like from a

00:38.700 --> 00:40.440
single action creator.

00:40.440 --> 00:47.060
So even though we are already dispatching logging users access here we can dispatch many others as well.

00:47.680 --> 00:53.730
OK so I think a good place to start is going to be to assign logging users access to an actual Konst

00:54.060 --> 00:55.290
inside of our type's file.

00:55.290 --> 00:56.810
That's a good easy place to start.

00:56.820 --> 00:57.920
So let's do it.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.260
I'm going to open up my type's file which is in my auctions directory and inside if you're going to

01:03.260 --> 01:12.590
create the new Konst export Konst log in user success.

01:12.620 --> 01:18.920
So this actually here is the type I should say is clearly meant to indicate to our inducers Hey something

01:18.920 --> 01:22.150
really could just happen like the user just logged in successfully.

01:22.430 --> 01:28.840
So now that I've got that type of flip back over to my action Kreator file I will import it at the top.

01:28.880 --> 01:36.260
So logging user success and then in my log in user action creator rather than using the string will

01:36.290 --> 01:39.700
use the type itself that costs the variable.

01:39.710 --> 01:41.860
However you want to refer to it fine by me.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.890
And now we can add this to our producer as well.

01:46.890 --> 01:52.010
So I flip over to my order reducer and we can catch this action when it comes across.

01:52.020 --> 01:58.420
So we've got e-mail changed password changed and also logged in users success.

01:58.530 --> 02:05.580
Now that we've got this type in here we can also make use of it inside of our juicer itself.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.340
So now comes the really interesting question.

02:08.670 --> 02:13.390
What are the properties that we want to update when every user successfully logs in.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.450
Well we know that we get that user in there.

02:16.470 --> 02:21.590
Right we get that user model from firebase and we attach it as the payload to the action.

02:21.750 --> 02:27.990
So by default I think a great place to start is going to be to make sure that we reflect the user model

02:28.080 --> 02:30.660
on our user piece of state.

02:30.660 --> 02:36.970
So whenever we successfully log in I'm going to return a new state object.

02:36.990 --> 02:44.370
So I say take all the existing properties on our state object and also include action payload which

02:44.370 --> 02:46.110
is our user.

02:46.170 --> 02:49.300
So now we're introducing the user property here.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.960
Again I'm going to to my initial state object as well just to tell any other engineers who look at this

02:54.960 --> 02:59.710
that hey there is a user property in play somewhere inside of this reducer.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.150
Cool.

03:00.180 --> 03:06.150
So now when a user successfully logs in we will save that user model which has their email and their

03:06.150 --> 03:11.300
I.D. on the state DOT off dot user piece of state.

03:11.460 --> 03:16.170
That's going be really important later on because we are going to make use of the user model early the

03:16.170 --> 03:18.610
user's I.D. and several other locations.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.880
So we'll want to definitely remember that little factoid.

03:22.200 --> 03:22.530
OK.

03:22.590 --> 03:27.360
Let's get to the next section and make sure that we can also handle the creation of user accounts
