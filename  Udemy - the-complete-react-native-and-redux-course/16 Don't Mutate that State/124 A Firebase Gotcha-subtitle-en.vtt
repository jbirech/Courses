WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:04.620
In the last section we got our sign up at least kind of doing something right.

00:04.620 --> 00:10.110
You know we can send your message on here but if I enter an incorrect password I see authentication

00:10.110 --> 00:11.300
failed pop up.

00:11.490 --> 00:16.290
If I then replace it with the correct password I can attempt to sign it again but the message does not

00:16.290 --> 00:17.260
go away.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.260
So definitely we need to make sure that we clear out this error message.

00:21.630 --> 00:24.750
Luckily it's really straightforward to do with redux.

00:24.750 --> 00:29.100
Right here we've got a case in our inducer of log in user success.

00:29.340 --> 00:30.790
So if a user just logged in.

00:30.840 --> 00:36.020
Chances are there is no error message to show them right like we don't need to show an error message.

00:36.090 --> 00:40.850
Surely they just logged in successfully so the authentication did not fail.

00:40.860 --> 00:43.510
You don't tell me it failed when it clearly just succeeded.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.280
So to get the message to go away we can just zero out the message like so.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.570
So just an empty string on there and the error message should be should go away.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.390
Is all refreshed now.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.870
And also attempt to sign in.

00:58.010 --> 01:06.210
You get the error message and I'll put in correct credentials and it goes away.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.950
Fantastic just what we expected.

01:07.950 --> 01:11.890
Now I want to show you something like real very small oddity.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.380
OK and this is an oddity of firebase.

01:14.430 --> 01:16.540
I'm just going to point out to you.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.510
It is something that bit me just a little bit while developing this application.

01:20.520 --> 01:24.740
I imagine some number of people out there are going to run into this and so I want to point this out.

01:24.810 --> 01:30.550
Tell you what the behavior is right now so you can expect it while you're debugging your application.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.340
I'm going to do a little interesting something here.

01:32.480 --> 01:40.560
I want to put a new line about that logging user's success and I'm just going to say B C G.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.230
What do you think is going to happen when our app runs this line of code right here.

01:47.370 --> 01:51.110
Well we haven't declared a variable called ABC TFG.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.270
Let's use something more reasonable like hello banana.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.070
There you go.

01:55.290 --> 01:59.030
So when this line of code is executed I'm going to expect an error message to occur.

01:59.050 --> 01:59.260
Right.

01:59.280 --> 02:05.370
I don't expect to see a big red error message on the screen in my simulator and say I have no idea what

02:05.370 --> 02:06.890
variable you're talking about here.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.600
OK that's what we expect that's what we want to have happen.

02:09.820 --> 02:12.740
It's not going to refresh the simulator input.

02:12.770 --> 02:14.580
Test test dot com.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.500
I'm going to put it in my correct password.

02:16.500 --> 02:24.150
So now I will expect this line of code to execute right here so I'm going to log in and I get.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.750
Authentication failed.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.750
How interesting right.

02:27.770 --> 02:29.300
How interesting.

02:29.300 --> 02:35.300
Surely this line of exit line of code is executed right like surely ASCII we just saw the error message

02:35.300 --> 02:40.610
go away a second ago so I know it's hitting that line of code and I know I just put in the correct password.

02:40.610 --> 02:46.220
But for some reason rather than throwing an error on this message right here I get authentication failed.

02:46.370 --> 02:51.380
So this is again a little bit of an oddity of firebase something that can be a little bit frustrating

02:51.380 --> 02:54.130
if you don't expect it so I'm going to tell you what it is right now.

02:54.380 --> 02:58.000
You'll probably go like oh that's rule not helpful.

02:58.490 --> 03:02.390
But you know hopefully they'll help you debug stuff in the future.

03:02.390 --> 03:09.710
So I want you to remember that whenever we call or X whenever we press that loggin button right here

03:09.920 --> 03:12.850
we are calling log in user right we call logging user.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.330
We attempt to sign him with an email and password.

03:15.690 --> 03:23.600
OK if we didn't not have that banana variable in there I would expect to hit Daut then call logging

03:23.620 --> 03:25.780
user success.

03:25.820 --> 03:30.620
We dispatch a log in the user success action and then it flows over.

03:30.650 --> 03:34.730
So eventually we end up over here and the producer and I hit this line of code right here right.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.740
That is my expected flow.

03:36.740 --> 03:39.760
That is what I expect to have happen and I'm going to tell ya.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.950
That is exactly what is happening.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.740
We are hitting this line of code right here.

03:44.750 --> 03:48.400
We are executing banana and an error is being thrown.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.010
Here's the problem.

03:50.670 --> 03:55.190
I want you to think for a second about our call stack right like the order in which we're calling all

03:55.190 --> 03:56.530
these different functions.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.360
So we hit sign in with email and password.

03:59.390 --> 04:02.440
When that resolves we run this function right here.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.810
So logging user success in dispatching that action.

04:05.810 --> 04:10.430
We are still kind of like in the context of this it then.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.060
Or like in the context of this promise.

04:13.070 --> 04:18.430
So here's what's really going on behind the scenes logging user success runs.

04:18.440 --> 04:25.820
We dispatched the action we hit that line of code and the reducer in areas thrown and firebase sees

04:25.820 --> 04:30.500
the error in assumes that something went wrong with the request.

04:30.530 --> 04:36.680
It assumes that the request failed catastrophically and so it goes over to this catch statement right

04:36.680 --> 04:39.650
here and it executes the catch statement.

04:39.740 --> 04:44.180
So that is what is really going on behind the scenes and I can prove it to you.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.610
I'm going to put in here.

04:45.670 --> 04:50.610
Err so I'm going to receive whatever argument this function is being called with and I'm going to count

04:50.610 --> 04:51.260
the log.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.510
Err like so.

04:52.550 --> 04:57.030
All right so now I need to flip back over to the simulator.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.040
I'm going to pull open my chrome Council.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.470
Here it is.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.360
And now I'm going to put in my correct credentials.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.040
So I'm going to expect this to hit that banana line.

05:07.050 --> 05:15.630
It's all logging now and boom I get authentication fails and at the con. I see banana is not defined.

05:15.840 --> 05:20.010
Which is clearly not what I expect as not one and what I have happen.

05:20.220 --> 05:27.170
But if you look at the call stack your you can see that yes we were inside of user log in success.

05:27.270 --> 05:33.260
We attempt to dispatch an action and you know something else happening here basically we got hung up

05:33.270 --> 05:39.810
back in the promise it hit the catch case because it assumes something went wrong with the request and

05:39.810 --> 05:41.370
we ended up in the catch case.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.830
Definitely not what we really expected as far as catching an air goes.

05:45.900 --> 05:46.420
OK.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.320
So again this is a real gotcha.

05:48.330 --> 05:53.880
While using firebase not a great way to catch this one I'm going to recommend you do it for the rest

05:53.880 --> 05:57.680
of the Course just keep this log in this log message right here.

05:57.720 --> 06:03.180
And if you ever just ever so happen to make a mistake while using firebase especially as we're working

06:03.180 --> 06:08.270
through its authentication stuff you will see the error message pop up on the screen along with that

06:08.280 --> 06:10.880
like you know authentication failed message as well.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.980
So a little bit of a gotcha.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.080
This is a work around that we're going to use right now.

06:16.080 --> 06:16.920
All right.

06:17.430 --> 06:23.960
So we do have to fix up our douceur of course you know flip back over and remove that banana term.

06:24.480 --> 06:30.030
And now I should be able to refresh get my error message

06:32.980 --> 06:34.600
and then sign in successfully.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.990
And see the error message go away.

06:37.010 --> 06:37.470
Cool.

06:37.520 --> 06:37.790
OK.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.780
So looks good.

06:39.110 --> 06:42.310
Let's take a quick break and then come back and finish up with all that.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.300
You know making sure we show some spinners and all that coming good stuff.
