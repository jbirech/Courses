00:00.780 --> 00:05.690
In this section we're going to go through the installation of E-wrestling lint on top of vs code.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.170
So if you're using Visual Studio code you're in the right place.

00:09.210 --> 00:14.640
Let's go through the installation I'm inside of my project directory and I've currently got to open

00:14.640 --> 00:17.610
the index dot Iowa dot J.S. file.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.050
Now we've only got this file open just to verify that.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.050
Yes that works.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.690
After we actually install it.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.330
So let's go through the installation.

00:24.570 --> 00:29.610
The first thing we're going to do is flip over to our terminal and I'm inside the project directory

00:29.610 --> 00:30.330
right now.

00:30.420 --> 00:33.040
And I'm going to install Yes lint globally.

00:33.180 --> 00:38.320
So I'll run NPM install d'Asti Yes lint.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.090
This is going to take a minute to install.

00:40.110 --> 00:45.570
So while this is going to flip back over to Visual Studio code and do a little bit more setup over here

00:47.280 --> 00:53.350
on the left hand side I'm going to find my packages button and I'm going to install an extension called

00:53.660 --> 00:54.590
Yes lint.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.590
So do a search for E.S. lint.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.700
I see it as the first and only results in here.

00:59.820 --> 01:05.800
And we can just click install after I install it I will enable the extension.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.880
I'm going to be prompted to restart my editor.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.840
No problem let's do it.

01:13.330 --> 01:14.440
And we're back.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.320
So here we go.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.760
I'm going to flip back over really quick to my terminal.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.340
It looks like that global installation of yes land is complete.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.020
This global installation of Ascelin is used to do the actual parsing of the code that we write.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.020
So that is why we installed that.

01:29.020 --> 01:33.760
The second package that we needed to install really quickly is the actual ruleset that we're going to

01:33.760 --> 01:37.140
use to validate the javascript that we actually write.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.530
So remember by default.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.520
Yes lint does nothing for us.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.150
We have to give it a default rule set.

01:43.600 --> 01:50.080
So I'm going to install a bundle of rules that's already been written for us using NPM all execute NPM

01:50.110 --> 01:59.790
install dash dash save Dev Yes limt config Rallye coding.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.300
So I've got.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.160
Yes Slint dash config dash rally coding and we'll let the install itself.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.070
This is also going to take a moment to install.

02:08.090 --> 02:11.530
So while it's doing that we'll do one last piece of startup.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.870
I'm going to flip back over to Visual Studio code really quick.

02:14.990 --> 02:21.890
Am going to make a new file inside of my project directory so I'm going to make a new file called Dot

02:22.370 --> 02:23.960
Slint RC.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.200
So Dot.

02:25.270 --> 02:33.620
Yes r RC and inside of your we are going to tell us land that we want to use that rule set that we just

02:33.620 --> 02:35.180
installed with NPM.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.420
So I will add in a new object.

02:38.970 --> 02:39.600
Oh boy.

02:39.830 --> 02:40.490
Well that's legible.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.470
There you go.

02:41.540 --> 02:46.580
And then inside this object and put a set of double quotes make sure you're using double quotes you

02:46.580 --> 02:52.770
can not use single quotes to use double extends Rallye coding.

02:53.210 --> 03:00.340
So both extends and key and rarely coding are wrapped with double quotes like so now I'll just save

03:00.340 --> 03:01.520
this.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.150
Let's see how our installation is going up.

03:05.190 --> 03:07.400
Looks like the installation is all done.

03:07.490 --> 03:12.690
So the last thing I'm going to do is test this out inside of that index.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.140
SJS file.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.100
Let's try by just taking on a semi-colon or two.

03:18.210 --> 03:24.550
Andy me I get an error message popping up and I can put the semi-colon back on and we're back in business.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.330
Or I can delete the entire first line and now I get a whole bunch of big errors popping up on the screen

03:29.390 --> 03:34.430
so it definitely looks like we've successfully got Yeslam working inside of the code.

03:34.430 --> 03:36.570
Let's continue in the next section.
