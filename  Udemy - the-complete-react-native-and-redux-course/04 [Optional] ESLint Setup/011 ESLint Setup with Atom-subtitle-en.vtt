00:00.780 --> 00:05.980
In this section we're going to walk through the set up of each Slint inside of the atom code editor.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.950
So if you're not using atom you'll want to skip on to the next video that covers your very particular

00:10.950 --> 00:15.810
code editor is set up for Eastland is different for each editor and that's why we've got a series of

00:15.810 --> 00:20.720
different videos to explore how to set up yes linked with different editor.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.040
So with Adam let's get started.

00:23.190 --> 00:29.280
I've opened up my Adam editor inside of a project directory here and in our case it is our reac native

00:29.280 --> 00:29.900
project.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.180
But it doesn't matter what type of project reason Heslin for with it can be re-act native Riak J.S.

00:36.420 --> 00:40.380
Amber angular whatever it wants to be doesn't matter.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.880
So inside this project directory I'm going to open up a single file called index.

00:44.910 --> 00:45.650
I went on.

00:45.710 --> 00:46.440
Yes.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.410
Now the only reason I'm opening up this file is so we can test out our Linter and make sure it's working

00:51.420 --> 00:52.710
after we install it.

00:52.710 --> 00:56.780
So let's get started with the installation up at the very top left hand side.

00:56.790 --> 01:01.080
I'm going to click on out them and open up my editor preferences

01:03.950 --> 01:10.550
then on the left hand nav bar inside the preferences pane I would click on the install section and then

01:10.580 --> 01:16.330
inside of install we're going to search for a very particular package called Linter dash.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.180
Yes lint

01:21.040 --> 01:23.670
the first result that I see here is the Linter dash.

01:23.690 --> 01:26.980
Yes lint package and I will install it on the right hand side.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.070
And I'm also going to find the next package right beneath it.

01:30.070 --> 01:31.290
That's called Linter.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.900
If you don't see the next one on here is being winter.

01:33.910 --> 01:39.370
If it's anything else then you can just do another search for the or package itself and find it and

01:39.370 --> 01:39.980
install it.

01:40.030 --> 01:42.760
So we're also going to install Linter as well.

01:43.400 --> 01:43.770
OK.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.390
So installing these is going to take just a moment of time.

01:46.390 --> 01:51.860
So while that's occurring we're going to flip over to our terminal and do another little bit of setup

01:53.640 --> 01:56.750
we're also going to pull up our diagram on how yes lint works right here.

01:56.790 --> 02:03.330
So at this point in time we just started the installation of the Linter attached to Adam and Eve Slint

02:03.480 --> 02:06.750
the plug in that's going to run inside the atom editor as well.

02:06.780 --> 02:14.010
So now we need to install our configuration some pre-built set of rules for our Linter installation

02:14.010 --> 02:14.660
to run.

02:14.850 --> 02:17.060
So we're not going to write a rule set from scratch.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.650
We're just going to use one that has already been put together for us.

02:21.240 --> 02:29.730
So to install a Already pre-generated pre-built list of excellent rules in my project directory I will

02:29.730 --> 02:37.870
install NPM modules so will install with NPM install dash dash save dash dev.

02:38.010 --> 02:45.120
We're going to install this as a developer dependency and then we're going to install Yes Slint dash

02:45.240 --> 02:50.210
config dash Rallye coding like so.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.510
All right so let's install this and just let it do its thing.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.580
And while that's going I'll also check out my item preferences and just verify.

03:00.690 --> 03:01.110
OK.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.800
Both of them appear to have been installed successfully so I don't need any more settings any more.

03:05.800 --> 03:13.920
So close the settings pane at the top and I go back over to my terminal and just verify this installation

03:13.920 --> 03:15.610
is going to wrap up here in just a second.

03:22.170 --> 03:22.540
OK.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.090
Well that's just going to take forever.

03:24.090 --> 03:27.680
So that's going to last up for set up that we have to do.

03:27.840 --> 03:34.350
So we have to make sure that yes lint knows to use that rule set up or that rule bundle that we just

03:34.350 --> 03:39.960
install via NPM to tell us lint that we want to use that bundle of rules.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.460
We're going to add a configuration file to our project.

03:43.530 --> 03:49.420
So inside of my project directory I'm going to create a new file called Dot.

03:49.710 --> 03:50.680
Yes lint.

03:50.740 --> 03:54.890
RC So Dot make sure you add that dot on the front lint.

03:54.940 --> 04:03.790
RC So any setup that we want to do for E.S. lint for this particular project we add to this file right

04:03.790 --> 04:04.460
here.

04:04.470 --> 04:08.560
Remember this is going into the realm of project specific settings.

04:08.560 --> 04:14.710
So on every project that I start off where I want to use E.S. Lent I will need to add yes excellent

04:14.770 --> 04:16.130
RC file.

04:16.180 --> 04:19.080
Again this is project specific set up.

04:19.150 --> 04:26.170
So inside if you will do a little bit of project specific setup us I'll add on a set of curly braces

04:26.170 --> 04:32.590
to specify an object and then we're going to put in an inside of very specifically double quotes.

04:32.740 --> 04:40.450
The word extends with the key of Raley coding like so make sure that you've got double quotes on both

04:40.510 --> 04:43.360
extensions and Raley coding.

04:44.050 --> 04:50.320
So what this tells us Lin is to go and find a installed dependency inside the node modules directory

04:50.380 --> 04:54.160
which is what we just installed called Rallye coding.

04:54.190 --> 04:58.640
So we just installed and it looks like it just wrapped up successfully.

04:58.870 --> 05:03.890
We just installed an excellent config called specifically Rallye coding.

05:03.940 --> 05:04.890
So we're just telling.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.750
Yes Slint.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.550
Hey go use that configuration.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.790
We just downloaded.

05:09.790 --> 05:10.150
All right.

05:10.180 --> 05:16.810
Now the last step I'm going to close out the excellent file and to close out the index file and then

05:16.810 --> 05:19.360
reopen it and then once I reopen it.

05:19.360 --> 05:19.850
My.

05:19.870 --> 05:20.770
Yes.

05:21.140 --> 05:22.530
My Linter should be active.

05:22.540 --> 05:27.220
So if I start deleting some code you'll see that I start getting some error messages popping up on the

05:27.220 --> 05:28.980
screen specifically in this case.

05:28.990 --> 05:34.160
You know I just delete the semi-colon so it says a year Miss missing a semi-colon he can't do that.

05:34.390 --> 05:39.010
But then we can also start doing weird stuff like I don't know have a plus plus plus plus plus.

05:39.340 --> 05:44.990
And yup that looks good says Persinger unexpected token because we did a bunch of pluses and a sign

05:45.000 --> 05:49.070
in a row of your OK so that's it with yes Slint inside of them.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.650
That's all the set up we have to do.

05:50.770 --> 05:54.870
The one thing to keep in mind is that on any future project where you want to use.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.430
Yes lint you have to create the Slint RC file.

05:59.710 --> 06:06.800
Paste in this configuration and then you also need to install the yes Slint config Rallye coding package

06:06.800 --> 06:07.570
as well.

06:07.870 --> 06:12.790
Remember this package right here just contains a list of different rules to tell excellent how it should

06:12.790 --> 06:14.080
validate our code.

06:14.550 --> 06:16.200
OK so that's our setup.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.420
Let's get continued in the next section.
