00:00.800 --> 00:05.870
In this section we're going to go through the installation of yes land on Sublime Text 3.

00:05.930 --> 00:10.510
So specifically Sublime Text three Sublime Text two as far as I know is not supported.

00:10.530 --> 00:11.230
Excellent.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.330
So this is all going to be set up with Yeslam 3.

00:14.960 --> 00:20.180
So unfortunately yes Ursuline has a little bit of a hefty amount of setup here.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.660
So these are all the stuff we have to go through.

00:22.940 --> 00:28.570
And yes it is slightly painful to be honest with you this is a third time record of this section.

00:28.570 --> 00:34.760
So the last two times I made a tiny mistake hopefully no repeats this time no repeats are going to get

00:34.760 --> 00:35.720
through this in one go.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.830
All right.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.330
So first.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.510
Well you know what.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.480
I don't know how much sense there is to talk about all this installation here basically getting set

00:44.480 --> 00:47.300
up with subline just involves installing a bunch of junk.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.760
Let's just get started on it and go through the process.

00:50.810 --> 00:54.930
So first we are going to install Yeslam globally with NPM.

00:55.190 --> 01:01.520
So at my terminal I'm inside my project directory and I'm going to install the yes limt command line

01:01.520 --> 01:02.160
tool.

01:02.220 --> 01:06.790
OK so the command line tool is what actually parses and validates our code.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.710
We will execute NPM install DSG.

01:10.820 --> 01:19.220
Yes Lance is going to install the Yeslam package globally as indicated by the dash G right here.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.600
This is going to take a little bit to run.

01:20.600 --> 01:24.050
So let's continue with the rest of the installation while that goes.

01:24.050 --> 01:30.010
The next thing we're going to do is install package control package control as a package manager for

01:30.020 --> 01:31.240
Sublime Text 3.

01:31.250 --> 01:37.550
So it's just something that's going to allow us to easily install other packages to install package

01:37.550 --> 01:49.130
control 3 I to open up my browser and I'm going to navigate to package control dot IO slash installation

01:51.860 --> 01:57.710
then once here on the left side we're going to go through the simple installation process which really

01:57.710 --> 01:59.670
is pretty straightforward.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.820
I'm going to copy this big block of text right here.

02:03.830 --> 02:07.990
Everything from the import statement to the right by at the bottom.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.910
So I hit command C to copy it.

02:10.910 --> 02:16.710
Now we'll go back over to Sublime Text and I need to paste this into some blinds console.

02:16.910 --> 02:24.300
So I go up to the View tab at the top click Show console and then I will paste it all in here.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.610
Everything that we just copied.

02:25.610 --> 02:32.630
So the very last token in here will be right by when I enter and this will install package control for

02:32.630 --> 02:33.260
us.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.720
And I've already got package control installed so I am not really doing any additional insulation here.

02:38.780 --> 02:41.290
You'll want to make sure that it just completes installing.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.510
You only take a second or two.

02:44.390 --> 02:48.670
So next we've got our package control installed.

02:48.740 --> 02:55.250
We are going to install a configuration for yes lint within PM So this config part that we're about

02:55.250 --> 03:03.450
to do right here is all about this last half loops the last half on our diagram.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.620
Remember we have some per project set up that we have to do.

03:06.620 --> 03:11.000
So what we're about to do is the per project set up it's going to move the actual configuration that

03:11.000 --> 03:16.220
tells us and hey when you parse the code and make sure it's valid please use this set of rules to figure

03:16.220 --> 03:17.700
out what is going on.

03:18.200 --> 03:25.450
So back at my terminal all take note looks like gasoline is all done installing.

03:25.670 --> 03:33.460
We're going to install some configuration for it yes lint it run and install dash dash save dash dev.

03:33.980 --> 03:39.750
Yes Lintz Klein fig Rallye coding like so.

03:39.980 --> 03:47.930
So yes Slint dash config dash Rallye coding so we'll hit enter and let this thing do its little installation

03:48.020 --> 03:54.750
and it will keep working while that goes just installing that configuration inside of our project to

03:54.770 --> 03:56.380
that set of rules isn't enough.

03:56.380 --> 04:01.590
We have to actually tell ESPN to make use of that said approve of or that list of rules.

04:01.630 --> 04:06.730
So to tell excellent to use that set of rules we're going to create a new configuration file inside

04:06.730 --> 04:08.620
of our root project directory.

04:08.980 --> 04:15.710
So inside of my root project directory I'm going to make a new file called Daut.

04:15.910 --> 04:17.120
Yes lint.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.240
RC And I'll save it.

04:21.490 --> 04:27.280
So now I've got a new file inside my root project directory called Daut.

04:27.300 --> 04:33.630
Yes Lynn RC and it's completely empty inside if you're going to put just a little bit of configuration.

04:33.630 --> 04:42.900
I'm going to place a set of curly braces and then inside the curly braces all add in extends colon Raley

04:42.900 --> 04:44.030
coding.

04:44.670 --> 04:45.610
So again this tells.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.430
Excellent.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.670
Hey we just installed a set of configuration for you.

04:49.740 --> 04:53.060
Please use the configuration called Rallye coding.

04:53.190 --> 05:00.810
Do take note that you must use double quotes around each word here so double quotes around extends and

05:00.810 --> 05:04.260
double quotes around Raley coding as well.

05:05.210 --> 05:05.570
All right.

05:05.580 --> 05:06.780
So just two more steps.

05:06.780 --> 05:09.770
We're almost there almost there.

05:10.020 --> 05:15.550
We have now added in our config with NPM we have actually skipped to the bottom.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.840
We add in the config file to our project.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.760
So the last two things are to do.

05:19.810 --> 05:25.770
Are we going to use the package control module that we just installed to install Linter and excellent

05:25.780 --> 05:28.580
to sublime Tex.

05:28.870 --> 05:36.270
So back in sight of our project I'm going to install or use package control to install those two modules.

05:36.270 --> 05:43.550
First I'll open up the command palette by pressing command shift key and this opens up the command palette

05:43.590 --> 05:52.330
as a list of all things I can do with sublime text I'm going to search for install and then click on

05:52.330 --> 05:55.990
the install package section.

05:56.270 --> 06:00.050
This will do a little bit of loading and then show me a list of all the different packages that I can

06:00.050 --> 06:01.070
install.

06:01.370 --> 06:08.720
First we're going to look for sublime limiter and I'll find the first result right here is just sublime

06:08.720 --> 06:09.240
Linter.

06:09.260 --> 06:13.960
I will click it to install it and there we go nice and installed.

06:14.510 --> 06:21.020
And next I'll open up the command palette again with command shift P I will click on install package

06:21.020 --> 06:31.950
again and then this time around we are going to look for sublime Linter Dasch contrib dash Yes lint

06:32.570 --> 06:37.030
so subline Linter Dasch contrib dash Yes lint.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.540
So here's the result right here.

06:38.570 --> 06:42.820
And I'll click it to install it and I'll click out that message right there.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.740
OK so last step I'm going to close out sublime text entirely.

06:49.060 --> 06:57.730
So I just quit entirely from it and I started back up and I got my project folder still open right here.

06:57.780 --> 07:01.180
So last thing I have to do is just test this out make sure it works.

07:01.230 --> 07:08.820
I'm going to open up this index file and I'm going to delete a semi colon here at the end and I'm going

07:08.820 --> 07:10.730
to save the file.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.810
And you'll notice.

07:11.860 --> 07:15.950
Yup sure enough I get this error message popping up says here.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.360
Missing semi colon.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.600
The rule is semi-new.

07:18.750 --> 07:24.300
If you don't see the this little red dot over here and you know the Red Square pop up do you make sure

07:24.300 --> 07:30.740
that you save the file and also try changing the line that your cursor is on inside of Sublime Text

07:30.770 --> 07:35.850
the Linter is a little bit laggy and so sometimes it takes a second for it to realize oh hey you just

07:35.850 --> 07:41.160
fix the error so you'll notice that when I delete the semi-colon you know we're waiting we're waiting.

07:41.180 --> 07:42.850
Oh there's an error here.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.390
You know when I fix it we're waiting.

07:45.420 --> 07:45.750
OK.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.960
There it goes.

07:47.520 --> 07:47.840
OK.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.970
So here is yes let's set up a Sublime Text.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.720
I know not the easiest thing in the world to do in the future.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.700
Now whenever you want to use E.S. lint with Sublime Text You can create this dot.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.290
Yes.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.050
RC file right here.

08:03.050 --> 08:09.030
Paste in this rule and then make sure that you just run out the terminal that NPM installed.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.740
Dash dash save dev excellent config Raley coding.

08:12.810 --> 08:13.700
That's all you have to do.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.040
So in the future no more complicated set up.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.520
It's a one time thing.

08:17.940 --> 08:18.810
OK so we've got.

08:18.810 --> 08:20.500
Yes let's set up a sublime text.

08:20.550 --> 08:22.770
Let's continue in the next section.
