WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:06.470
We now have a list item component that will be responsible for showing a single library at a library

00:06.480 --> 00:11.150
that this row will represent is available to us as this stock don't library.

00:11.210 --> 00:11.540
All right.

00:11.550 --> 00:14.580
Because we passed in the prop called Library.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.910
So inside of this component list item right here we can just reference process a library and Boomer.

00:19.940 --> 00:23.370
Good to go OK.

00:23.830 --> 00:31.190
So keep in mind that that library object that we passed in here has both a title and a description.

00:31.210 --> 00:37.010
So if I pull up in my library list Jason File and this is where we defined the libraries.

00:37.030 --> 00:42.270
It has a title a description and of course it has the idea of wealth as well.

00:42.340 --> 00:49.150
So we need to like basically add some GSX into our render method that shows the title and the description

00:49.280 --> 00:51.160
you know because that's what we really want to show to the user.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.550
That's what we want to communicate.

00:54.330 --> 00:54.670
OK.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.780
So inside the list item I'm thinking that we should probably make reuse of some of the components we've

01:00.780 --> 01:01.600
already created.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.070
Right because we've got all these great looking components already made.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.710
So I want to reuse something out there.

01:07.740 --> 01:14.310
I don't suggest that we show a card section component and put the name of the library inside of it.

01:14.310 --> 01:21.060
Then whenever I use it like TAPS that card will expand with a second card 6 section with the library's

01:21.060 --> 01:21.890
description.

01:22.020 --> 01:27.870
So whenever a user taps on the thing that's when we want to expand it and show the library's description.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.420
Now note that I said that we only want to use the card section component here instead of the card as

01:33.420 --> 01:33.980
well.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.470
And you'll see exactly why that is we checked this out inside the simulator.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.170
OK.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.930
So first we will import the card section of the talk.

01:42.990 --> 01:53.410
So I will import a card section from the common folder then I will place it inside the render method.

01:53.530 --> 02:07.860
So I will return a card section like So next we do need to place the name of the library inside of the

02:07.860 --> 02:13.430
card section so we'll need a text tag to be able to show some text inside of here.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.780
We don't have a text tag imported just yet so we import that from the re-act native library.

02:18.780 --> 02:24.390
So at the top import texts from re-act native.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.410
Now inside the text section we can place our text tag

02:31.260 --> 02:38.340
and inside the text tag I will reference this props library dot title.

02:38.790 --> 02:45.300
Remember the library is passed in as a prop called Title and library Earthsea has a code library and

02:45.300 --> 02:48.020
the library itself has a property called Title.

02:48.030 --> 02:51.540
So that's why we have this Propst out library that title right here.

02:52.090 --> 02:52.780
OK.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.410
Probably a good time to check this out in the simulator.

02:55.410 --> 02:56.280
Let's see how we're doing.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.390
Make sure everything works.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.950
So don't flip back over the simulator.

02:58.950 --> 03:00.490
Let's refresh.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.250
And all right.

03:02.250 --> 03:02.810
Hot dog.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.640
That does not look half bad.

03:05.070 --> 03:07.420
Definitely does not look half bad.

03:07.470 --> 03:12.660
You'll notice that because we are using the list view component by default we get some nice scrolling

03:12.660 --> 03:13.630
behavior.

03:13.680 --> 03:19.980
Of course it looks like when I scroll down the with the list stops right here which is maybe not intended.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.500
See it's kind of cut off right there.

03:21.660 --> 03:26.510
So maybe you'll need to do a little bit of work on that front as a side note.

03:26.510 --> 03:31.800
This is why I want to use the card section without the card with just the card section.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.150
We get some really nice looking segmented rows like this right here.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.190
Right like the 20s is its own distinct row.

03:39.390 --> 03:44.700
Now the title of each library like you know battleaxe nosiest line all of these things.

03:44.710 --> 03:47.850
They could probably stand to be a little bit larger in text.

03:47.940 --> 03:52.780
So I think maybe we should add some styling to the text tag to accommodate for that.

03:52.800 --> 04:02.760
So at the bottom of our file here let's add in a styles object which will have a title style property

04:05.190 --> 04:11.430
and inside of your let's give it a font size of 18 and then you'll also notice that it kind of butts

04:11.430 --> 04:14.000
up so the left hand side of the screen that doesn't look too nice.

04:14.040 --> 04:21.330
So let's also give it a padding left of 15 as well just to get it to stand off from the left hand side

04:21.330 --> 04:23.760
of the screen a little bit.

04:24.270 --> 04:28.700
So we will then apply this style to our text tag.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.240
I think that we might have some other styling in here to take care of.

04:32.310 --> 04:38.760
So rather than applying it directly to the text tag I'm going to first structure the text or the title

04:38.760 --> 04:41.260
style off the styles object.

04:41.370 --> 04:53.700
So let's say Konst title style equals styles and then we will apply a style of title style.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.000
All right let's check out the simulator again.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.540
I will refresh.

04:58.710 --> 04:59.420
All right.

04:59.430 --> 05:03.630
Now this is starting to look pretty good it's starting to really look like a list of items.

05:04.110 --> 05:09.840
So to still have that one last issue that when I start to scroll down the list of items gets cut off

05:09.870 --> 05:14.130
arbitrarily right here which is probably not what I want at all.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.870
So again we ran into this in the past.

05:16.950 --> 05:23.550
If I flip back to my app component and I find my top level view tag I need to tell my top level view

05:23.640 --> 05:27.210
tag to fill up as much space as possible.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.530
Right now it's that view tag that is actually kind of cutting off our list here.

05:31.530 --> 05:39.630
So I'm going to add the property or the style of flex 1 to my view tag and that is going to tell the

05:39.750 --> 05:45.600
tag hey please fill up as much space as possible because we've got like a lot of content that we won't

05:45.630 --> 05:46.820
show on the screen.

05:46.860 --> 05:53.250
Do note that I passed the style prop here two sets of curly braces you know one is for GSX and the inner

05:53.250 --> 05:57.600
one is for to designate a javascript object.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.870
So let's refresh in the simulator now and when I scroll down.

06:00.870 --> 06:06.000
Fantastic view tag is definitely taking up the full height of the screen and my content is no longer

06:06.000 --> 06:07.840
getting cut off.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.380
OK this looks pretty darn good.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.530
So this really brings phase one of our application to a close.

06:13.530 --> 06:18.930
You know we are able to render a list of items in the screen using a highly performant component the

06:18.930 --> 06:19.710
list view.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.890
So we're now going to move on to our next feature in which we will need to show a user details about

06:25.890 --> 06:28.260
a particular library whenever they tap on it.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.610
So let's start that process in the next section
