00:01.590 --> 00:06.210
We're definitely picking up in this show with our header tag here so let's keep on rolling along and

00:06.210 --> 00:08.340
start fixing amps and the styling.

00:08.340 --> 00:12.300
When you look at the header in the style you'll see in the simulator excuse me you'll see that there

00:12.300 --> 00:16.560
is a little bit too little space right here and there we can definitely use a little bit more space

00:16.560 --> 00:20.030
between the image and the text to the right hand side.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.740
In addition it would be really nice if the first piece of text in here which was the album title was

00:25.740 --> 00:31.530
just a little bit larger at least or hopefully a little bit bolder as well just to make it stand out

00:31.530 --> 00:33.630
a little bit.

00:33.630 --> 00:38.300
So let's start by fixing some of the spacing with this image here.

00:38.310 --> 00:43.650
We'll achieve this by adding some styling to the view tag that is wrapping the image.

00:43.650 --> 00:49.210
So on this the tag right here will set up some margin on the left and right hand side.

00:49.380 --> 00:52.510
That means we're going to have to add another property to our styles object.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.120
So we'll go down to our styles object at the bottom and I'm going out on another property.

00:57.130 --> 01:01.410
They're going to call a thumbnail container style.

01:02.220 --> 01:08.480
So the thought process behind this name right here is that the container that is containing the thumbnails

01:08.490 --> 01:11.280
so you know thumbnail container style.

01:11.850 --> 01:18.270
So for this container right here I also want to kind of center the thumbnail in there right.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.800
I want to make sure this myson centered to make sure that sintered will give it the justify content

01:23.280 --> 01:30.630
of center and align items of center as well and will give it some left and right and spacing by giving

01:30.630 --> 01:36.400
it the margin left of 10 and a margin right of 10 as well.

01:37.230 --> 01:44.540
Now we can add this thumbnail container style to that view that we have up top so I'll scroll back up.

01:44.610 --> 01:47.960
I'm going to put in some new lines here.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.610
Now that I've got a pretty good number of things I need to restructure my styles object.

01:52.800 --> 02:02.140
And then I will pull in my thumbnail container style then we're going to take that style and just use

02:02.140 --> 02:03.350
it on the View tag.

02:03.580 --> 02:10.140
So hey view here you go use your style thumbnail container style cool.

02:10.140 --> 02:15.040
Now remember the other thing that I mentioned is I would really like if our header text you know so

02:15.060 --> 02:21.610
the text tag that has the artist title or the title was a little bit larger and maybe bolded as well.

02:21.660 --> 02:26.170
Let's start off by just making it larger and then we'll decide whether or not we want to build it.

02:26.220 --> 02:31.470
So I'm going to scroll back down and we're going to add a another text rule and here I'm going to put

02:31.470 --> 02:37.130
this one right underneath the header content style because this is the one that's holding the textile.

02:37.740 --> 02:44.610
Add a single rule to just add on to that text and call this one.

02:44.670 --> 02:47.770
Let's do Hetter text style.

02:50.670 --> 02:58.830
And I will give it a font size of 18 so now we'll place this textile as well.

02:58.830 --> 03:07.730
So I will scroll back up to restructure it and then add it to our first text tag.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.450
So here's the first text tag.

03:09.600 --> 03:16.910
It has the album title and I'll give it the style of header text style.

03:17.170 --> 03:17.980
All right.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.480
Time for the moment of truth how are we doing.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.830
How are we doing that check it out.

03:20.890 --> 03:23.010
Let's refresh the simulator.

03:24.010 --> 03:24.470
OK.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.500
Now this is starting to look pretty good right here.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.100
This is definitely coming along.

03:28.120 --> 03:34.750
We've got the nice slightly larger you know not too large but just slightly larger album title at the

03:34.750 --> 03:35.290
top.

03:35.350 --> 03:40.360
We've got some spacing to the left and right hand side of the image and the image is kind of centered

03:40.600 --> 03:43.780
vertically and horizontally inside of that container as well.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.540
So this is definitely getting towards where we want to be.

03:49.290 --> 03:53.970
So let's now continue and start working on the body of each card member of the body of each card we

03:53.970 --> 04:01.100
want it to have the album artwork and we've already got access to the album artwork on our album object.

04:01.170 --> 04:05.880
So if we go back to our album object you'll recall it's available as the image property.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.840
So your image image image each one has the artwork image.

04:11.190 --> 04:17.250
So we want to just add in a new card section right because this is a new section on the card and inside

04:17.250 --> 04:23.940
of that card section we just want to show this album cover just the album cover nothing else so shouldn't

04:23.940 --> 04:24.550
be too bad.

04:24.550 --> 04:28.070
Well in first the card section and then Image card.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.970
Is the image tag inside of it.

04:30.450 --> 04:34.610
So beneath our existing card section we'll add in another one

04:38.410 --> 04:41.300
and then we can add in an image tag as well.

04:43.480 --> 04:48.900
Again I'll give it the source property define you or I.

04:49.140 --> 04:55.150
And if you recall that Al or that image link you know the the actual thing we want to use here is available

04:55.150 --> 04:58.210
as props dot album dot image.

04:58.300 --> 05:05.530
But we are doing some destructuring so I'm going to reference just image and I'll scroll back up to

05:05.530 --> 05:07.510
my album destructuring right here.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.720
And I'm also going to need a structure out of my album.

05:09.730 --> 05:12.830
I'm going to structure out the image property as well.

05:12.910 --> 05:20.540
So I've got my title artist thumbnail image and image coming directly out of the album so I'll go back

05:20.540 --> 05:21.090
down.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.140
Yup we're all good to go.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.090
Let's refresh the simulator.

05:28.550 --> 05:29.360
And ok.

05:29.370 --> 05:29.650
Yup.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.230
It looks like we definitely have the additional section on here.

05:32.240 --> 05:38.060
But as you might expect we did not set a height or a width to the image right here.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.280
And so it didn't actually show up inside the simulator you know.

05:41.300 --> 05:46.120
Theoretically it's there theoretically the image is there but we did not give it a high or a with.

05:46.130 --> 05:50.220
So it gets condensed down to basically zero.

05:50.300 --> 05:54.100
This time around however we decide on the dimensions of our image.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.320
Things start to get a little bit interesting if you think about it.

05:57.320 --> 06:01.640
Remember I said that we have to specify the height and the width of the image.

06:01.820 --> 06:06.830
But this time we have an image that we want to stretch all the way from the left hand side all the way

06:06.830 --> 06:08.030
to the right hand side.

06:08.210 --> 06:13.040
And that with the right there that is not something that's very easy for us to hard code right.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.210
It's not easy for us to hard code that value and here's why.

06:16.490 --> 06:21.920
We do know in theory you know maybe we haven't really done this but in theory theory we know that with

06:22.010 --> 06:23.850
the device that we're on right.

06:24.020 --> 06:29.040
But then we will also have to add in like the margin over here the margin over here.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.390
And then any internal margin to the card section as well.

06:32.390 --> 06:38.660
In other words it's just really tough to calculate the width of our image we want it to span the entire

06:38.660 --> 06:41.220
width of this card section right here.

06:41.510 --> 06:47.220
So to solve this we're going to use just a little trick with re-act native styling images.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.230
Galleries a little trick.

06:49.280 --> 06:55.220
First we'll add in a new style to our styles object and I call this one just image style.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.150
So then here's the trick I am going to set a fixed height.

06:59.140 --> 07:04.180
Now I'm going to say that's going to be 300 which is a pretty respectable height.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.140
Now here's where it gets interesting.

07:06.140 --> 07:11.030
To make sure that the image takes up the full width available to it you know always from the left hand

07:11.030 --> 07:18.590
side of the card to the right hand side and you throw on a property of flex 1 and a with specifically

07:18.590 --> 07:19.450
of NULL.

07:19.700 --> 07:24.110
So I know you know your thing yourself Stephen Noal is basically like undefined Why do we even have

07:24.110 --> 07:24.680
to define it.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.890
Just trust me here.

07:26.060 --> 07:29.220
I'm going to provide a with of no.

07:29.390 --> 07:32.760
Now I will apply this image style to that image tag.

07:33.080 --> 07:42.380
So I go back up to the last image and I'm going to give it a style of image style and then we also need

07:42.380 --> 07:45.200
to structure this out of our style object.

07:45.200 --> 07:51.970
So scroll up a little bit more find my image or see my style's object right here and I'll also destructuring

07:51.980 --> 07:53.750
out the image style.

07:54.890 --> 07:55.430
OK.

07:55.770 --> 07:59.720
So let's give this a shot inside of our simulator now.

08:00.450 --> 08:03.900
I'll refresh our hot dog.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.460
That is exactly what we wanted.

08:05.460 --> 08:11.370
Our image is stretching all the way from the left hand side to the right hand side as well as perfect.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.910
So let's scroll down to see you.

08:13.980 --> 08:20.220
Wait a minute wait a minute I'm clicking and dragging here which is traditionally how you scroll in

08:20.220 --> 08:24.180
the simulator but it appears that there is no scrolling behavior whatsoever.

08:24.180 --> 08:27.120
So that is definitely not expected.

08:27.120 --> 08:32.270
We have five albums on this list though so I know there are Alban's further down the list but I apparently

08:32.280 --> 08:33.390
just cannot scroll to them.

08:33.390 --> 08:36.170
So we definitely have a little bit of an issue here.

08:36.420 --> 08:40.140
Let's continue in the next section in and explore this bug a little bit more.
