00:01.280 --> 00:06.630
In the last section we spoke a little bit more about Justified content with fluxbox and what it does

00:06.630 --> 00:08.950
to some elements within a container.

00:09.150 --> 00:16.400
We spoke about flex and center space between and then space around as well.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.800
So in the section where we're going to figure out how to actually apply these to our particular case

00:21.900 --> 00:26.950
you know styling our header it's going to go the next slide here.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.010
So back on track or focusing on the head.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.200
We have our profile image on the left which you know we still have to create these things so we all

00:34.230 --> 00:38.950
get to that and then we've also got some stacked content on the right hand side.

00:38.970 --> 00:40.880
You know the two lines of text.

00:41.010 --> 00:46.440
So the interesting dynamic here is that we want to line up the two lines of text so the stack on top

00:46.440 --> 00:51.390
of each other but both lines of text need to be next to the image.

00:51.390 --> 00:55.460
So as a solution I'm going to suggest we take the following approach.

00:55.620 --> 01:03.000
We'll wrap both the image and the text the two text tags with two separate views.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.810
So one of you to wrap the image and then one view to wrap the two text tags inside of here.

01:09.510 --> 01:17.130
Then we can use the justified content of flex start to get both these items to push up to the left hand

01:17.130 --> 01:19.550
side of the container here.

01:19.590 --> 01:21.350
Just one quick issue though.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.350
One quick issue.

01:22.350 --> 01:27.180
Everything we've been discussing about justify content has mentioned that we use it for positioning

01:27.210 --> 01:31.020
elements in the vertical or up and down direction.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.030
So how are we going to use justify Cancian right here to the lineup items on the left and right direction

01:36.030 --> 01:41.880
like I just suggested and that's basically my lead into one of the last confusing fluxbox items we need

01:41.880 --> 01:46.140
to discuss the idea of flex direction.

01:46.140 --> 01:54.270
So first I want to very quickly remind you that back in when the previous sections inside of our card

01:54.270 --> 01:58.610
section we added on a property flex direction of row right.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.610
So we've kind of already done the wire for this and now we're just kind of going back in discussing

02:02.610 --> 02:04.490
exactly why we did that.

02:05.110 --> 02:05.430
OK.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.950
So Flex direction property.

02:08.970 --> 02:16.650
So here's what flex direction does the justified content rule can be used to apply to either vertical

02:17.160 --> 02:18.850
or horizontal layout.

02:18.870 --> 02:26.610
So either direction the direction that it will apply to is determined by the flex direction rule with

02:26.610 --> 02:30.610
re-act native The Flex direction rule defaults to column.

02:30.630 --> 02:37.470
So by default all of the justified content rules we place all over the place applied to the vertical

02:37.470 --> 02:44.940
positioning of items if we wanted to make it apply to the horizontal layout of items however we can

02:44.940 --> 02:47.230
change flex direction to row.

02:47.250 --> 02:55.950
Instead when we change it to row it then turns flex direction to spacing items in the horizontal direction.

02:56.190 --> 02:59.220
So this is exactly how we're going to solve our layout issue.

03:01.970 --> 03:02.950
So here's the plan.

03:03.080 --> 03:08.180
We're going to create two separate views for the header like we previously discussed just a minute ago.

03:08.360 --> 03:13.160
One is going to wrap the image and the second one is going to wrap the two text tags.

03:13.160 --> 03:19.160
Then on the card section which we already created we will give it the properties flex direction of row

03:19.370 --> 03:21.120
and justify content.

03:21.260 --> 03:26.910
Flex start so flex direction row is going to say hey all of the items inside.

03:26.910 --> 03:33.140
Card section should lay themselves out going left to right instead of top down or top to bottom excuse

03:33.140 --> 03:40.700
me and then justify content of flex star will say will mean push those items all the way up to the start

03:40.760 --> 03:44.170
edge of the container which will be the left hand side in this case.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.590
So again we have already gone ahead and added these two properties to our card section.

03:48.590 --> 03:53.970
So that is completely done everything should work as we expect because we added these two properties

03:55.760 --> 04:00.920
one last thing we also need to make sure that we know how to lay out our two lines of text vertically

04:00.920 --> 04:02.760
within the view.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.740
So that's one more little challenge.

04:04.740 --> 04:05.700
We got to deal.

04:06.170 --> 04:11.450
So we're going to also introduce the idea of a tax container so that text containers are going to be

04:11.450 --> 04:15.590
just the view tag that we said we would use to wrap the two text tags.

04:15.590 --> 04:20.980
Then on the text container will say that should have a flex direction of column so it should layout

04:21.020 --> 04:26.890
its items top to bottom and it should have a justified content of space around.

04:27.040 --> 04:33.020
And remember that space round does it says layout equal spacing between all of the elements within the

04:33.050 --> 04:33.860
container.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.380
So we have two text tags in here.

04:36.380 --> 04:43.130
We will take some equal amount of whitespace and allocated between the top the middle and the bottom

04:43.220 --> 04:44.660
of those two text tags.

04:44.720 --> 04:51.830
So that's why we're going to use justify content of space around on that view container section.

04:51.860 --> 04:52.660
All right.

04:52.790 --> 04:57.520
So we've now spent a lot of time talking about fluxbox and how we're going to lay out this better.

04:57.920 --> 05:03.920
Again Fluxbox is really the one rule or the one great tool we have for doing it with Riak native.

05:03.920 --> 05:09.500
So it's very important that you have at least some reasonable idea of how flex blocks flex fluxbox layout

05:09.510 --> 05:13.610
works and that's why I wanted to have a little bit of an expanded lecture on it.

05:13.610 --> 05:18.410
So let's take all these rules all of these strategies that we've now looked at and apply them to our

05:18.410 --> 05:19.760
head or in the next section
