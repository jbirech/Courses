00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.390
In the last section we got our album artwork to show up but now we've got another problem.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.600
It appears that we can actually skirl through our list at all here.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.060
So in this section we're going to fix up that bug a little bit.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.460
Even though re-act need it has a lot of similarities with its web based cousin you know like running

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.680
react in the browser.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170
We've also seen a couple of differences.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.400
The way in which re-act native decides to handle scrolling definitely fits into that list of differences

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.110
as well.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
So by default when we make a really tall component re-act native It is not going to scroll.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.850
So by default no scrolling doesn't behave like the browser we must always be aware of when we are rendering

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.050
a component that must require the user to scroll like up and down through our application.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.460
Fortunately fixing this scrolling issue is a straightforward fix so enabling scrolling just takes two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.330
steps.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
First we will identify the GSX tags that we expect to be scrollable.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.380
So kind of like the bulk section of content that we want to be scrollable.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.350
And then second we will import a re-act made of component called skirl of you and wrap our content with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.670
that.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.100
So let's give this a shot.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.860
So step one we need to identify the content that we expect to be scrollable.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.810
So you might think well is that the album detail.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.510
Not quite.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.990
It is really the album list the album list is what renders our big old list of albums.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200
So its really this view right here.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.680
I expect everything inside of this view to be scrollable.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.040
So thats how we identify this we say what do I expect to be scrollable.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.720
So now Step 2 we need to import a component called scroll view and then replace our existing view with

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.360
that scroll of tag.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.000
So up at the top I will find my re-act native new component and I was going to replace this because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.470
we're not going to use the tag anymore or replace it with scroll of view.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.750
I mean going back down to our render method I'll find my view tag and I'll replace it with the scroll

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.440
view.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.800
So scroll view is just how we say hey you know what whatever is in here and I want it to scroll I'll

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.030
just make it scroll.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.660
So not the worst thing in the world.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.020
Let's test the sentence simulator now.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.080
Open it back up refresh.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.920
And now I should be able to click and drag.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.020
But wait a minute wait a minute I can scroll.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.890
But it appears that even though I scroll down everything appears to just bounce back here.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.870
So still a little bit of a kind of weird thing here going on.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.290
So here's the next gotcha of Riak native.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.070
And yes I know this framework has a lot of gotchas.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.860
That's why you're taking the course with me right.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.030
So you can find all the crazy things I've found and I'll just explain them to you.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.310
Nice and easy.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.260
So here we go.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.000
Whenever you have a scroll of view you must add a style property of flex 1 to your root element.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.410
So let's do that and I'll talk about exactly what's going on.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.480
So I got to go back to my index view right here is my index container my app component.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.110
I'm going to find my root view.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.970
Here it is.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.000
And I add to it a style of flex one.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.590
And because I'm just adding this one single style I'm not going to bother with a separate styles object

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.450
I was going to like passus in here.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.640
So with this flex one property does right as it says Please expand this component to fill the entire

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.300
content area of the device.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.460
So yes I know that it looked like that was already the case here.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.080
But again this is just one of those gotcha things you know I know that it looks like that scroll view

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.770
is taking up the entire width or area of the screen.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.300
But again it's one of those gotchas.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.280
So let's refresh this again.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.070
And now when I scroll.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.730
All right hot dog I'm scrolling through the entire list.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.310
Perfect.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.480
Just we want it.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.020
So as you're scrolling through I'm sure the video probably you can see it if it appears that it's laggy

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.710
at all.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.580
I guarantee you that is a property of the simulator.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.540
If you ever tested it on your device everything is going to be just buttery smooth scrolling.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.550
It is just because we're on the simulator and in particular not the best laptop in the world.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.540
So when you put this unreal device everything is going to scroll very nicely.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.310
OK.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.820
So we now have just one feature left in this application.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.680
We need to add a button to the bottom of each card here that our users can click to buy an album.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.340
So let's start off with that feature in the next section.
