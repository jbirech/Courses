00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.770
So appliques pretty great at this point in time.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.860
I think there's just one last thing we need to do.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.500
We need to make sure that the buttons text gets changed to something more reasonable then click me.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.040
So we could just change the text to something like by now inside of our button component.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.190
Right now here is the hard coded click me.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.620
But if we just change it to.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.980
By now we're still kind of defeating the purpose of making a reusable button component.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.170
So I feel like this would be a great opportunity to pass and the text Jones shown have this button as

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410
a prop to the button.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.070
Now there's two ways you could do this.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.000
We can either add any prop just like the on Press one of maybe something like you know text and it should

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.260
say like by now that would be one approach.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.520
The second approach I think might be a little bit you know more fun with the button component.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.030
You know something like this is to use that same prop stock children trick that we saw earlier.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.320
So let's do that instead.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.100
If you recall we expand out the button tag and then pass some text directly in here.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.420
We can then get a reference to this text as props start children inside of the button component.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.520
So now we can go back over to our button and replace clickety with a reference to Propst children.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.780
So notice that I don't have a prop's object or argument here I'm destruction of the arguments list.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.900
So I will just restructure out children as well.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.750
And then in place of click any place children call.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.660
So let's give this a test.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.210
And now we've got a much more reasonable by now on our buttons.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.230
Perfect.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.710
So again this is just a step to make sure that we've got a truly reusable component.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.460
Our button tag right now is 100 percent reusable.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.380
All over the place it is not tied to the implementation of the card section.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.890
And in fact there is absolutely no reference in here whatsoever to any type of album or you Arel or

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.810
artist name or anything like that.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.300
So we can definitely make reuse of this in future applications as well.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.580
OK.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.190
So I think that's just about it for our first application.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.990
I got to tell you I'm really happy with how this thing looks.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.360
I think it looks really professional.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.960
So let's take a little minute in the next section to do a wrap up on all the topics that we spoke about
